The studio was filled with the rich odour of roses,and when the light summer wind stirred amidst thetrees of the garden, there came through the opendoor the heavy scent of the lilac, or the moredelicate perfume of the pink-flowering thorn.
From the corner of the divan of Persian saddlebagson which he was lying, smoking, as was his custom,innumerable cigarettes, Lord Henry Wotton couldjust catch the gleam of the honey-sweet and honey-coloured blossoms of a laburnum, whose tremulousbranches seemed hardly able to bear the burden ofa beauty so flame-like as theirs; and now and thenthe fantastic shadows of birds in flight flitted acrossthe long tussore-silk curtains that were stretched infront of the huge window, producing a kind ofmomentary Japanese effect, and making him thinkof those pallid jade-faced painters of Tokio who,through the medium of an art that is necessarilyimmobile, seek to convey the sense of swiftness andmotion.
The sullen murmur of the bees shouldering theirway through the long unmown grass, or circling withmonotonous insistence round the dusty gilt horns ofthe straggling woodbine, seemed to make thestillness more oppressive.
The dim roar of London was like the bourdon note ofa distant organ.
In the centre of the room, clamped to an uprighteasel, stood the full-length portrait of a young manof extraordinary personal beauty, and in front of it,some little distance away, was sitting the artisthimself, Basil Hallward, whose suddendisappearance some years ago caused, at the time,such public excitement, and gave rise to so manystrange conjectures.
As the painter looked at the gracious and comelyform he had so skilfully mirrored in his art, a smileof pleasure passed across his face, and seemedabout to linger there.
But he suddenly started up, and, closing his eyes,placed his fingers upon the lids, as though hesought to imprison within his brain some curiousdream from which he feared he might awake.
"It is your best work, Basil, the best thing you haveever done," said Lord Henry, languidly.
"You must certainly send it next year to the Grosvenor.
The Academy is too large and too vulgar.
Whenever I have gone there, there have been eitherso many people that I have not been able to see thepictures, which was dreadful, or so many picturesthat I have not been able to see the people, whichwas worse.
The Grosvenor is really the only place.
"I don't think I shall send it anywhere," he answered,tossing his head back in that odd way that used tomake his friends laugh at him at Oxford. "No: I won't send it anywhere."
Lord Henry elevated his eyebrows, and looked athim in amazement through the thin blue wreaths ofsmoke that curled up in such fanciful whorls fromhis heavy opium-tainted cigarette.
"Not send it anywhere?
My dear fellow, why?
Have you any reason?
What odd chaps you painters are!
You do anything in the world to gain a reputation. As soon as you have one, you seem to want to thro wit away.
It is silly of you, for there is only one thing in theworld worse than being talked about, and that is notbeing talked about.
A portrait like this would set you far above all theyoung men in England, and make the old men quitejealous, if old men are ever capable of any emotion."
"I know you will laugh at me," he replied, "but I really can't exhibit it.
I have put too much of myself into it.
Lord Henry stretched himself out on the divan and laughed.
"Yes, I knew you would; but it is quite true, all the same."
Too much of yourself in it!
Upon my word, Basil, I didn't know you were so vain;and I really can't see any resemblance between you,with your rugged strong face and your coal-blackhair, and this young Adonis, who looks as if he wasmade out of ivory and rose-leaves.
Why, my dear Basil, he is a Narcissus, and you—well,of course you have an intellectual expression, andall that.
But beauty, real beauty, ends where an intellectual expression begins.
Intellect is in itself a mode of exaggeration, anddestroys the harmony of any face.
The moment one sits down to think, one becomes allnose, or all forehead, or something horrid.
Look at the successful men in any of the learned professions. How perfectly hideous they are!
Except, of course, in the Church. But then in the Church they don't think.
Abishop keeps on saying at the age of eighty whathe was told to say when he was a boy of eighteen,and as a natural consequence he always looksabsolutely delightful.
Your mysterious young friend, whose name youhave never told me, but whose picture reallyfascinates me, never thinks.
I feel quite sure of that.
He is some brainless, beautiful creature, who shouldbe always here in winter when we have no flowersto look at, and always here in summer when wewant something to chill our intelligence.
Don't flatter yourself, Basil: you are not in the least like him.
"You don't understand me, Harry," answered the artist. "Of course I am not like him.
I know that perfectly well.
Indeed, I should be sorry to look like him.
You shrug your shoulders?
I am telling you the truth.
There is a fatality about all physical and intellectualdistinction, the sort of fatality that seems to dogthrough history the faltering steps of kings.
It is better not to be different from one's fellows.
The ugly and the stupid have the best of it in this world.
They can sit at their ease and gape at the play.
If they know nothing of victory, they are at leastspared the knowledge of defeat.
They live as we all should live, undisturbed,indifferent, and without disquiet.
They neither bring ruin upon others, nor everreceive it from alien hands.
Your rank and wealth, Harry; my brains, such as theyare—my art, whatever it may be worth; DorianGray's good looks—we shall all suffer for what thegods have given us, suffer terribly."
Dorian Gray?
Is that his name?" asked Lord Henry, walking acrossthe studio towards Basil Hallward.
"Yes, that is his name.
I didn't intend to tell it to you."
"But why not?"
"Oh, I can't explain.
When I like people immensely I never tell their names to anyone.
It is like surrendering a part of them.
I have grown to love secrecy.
It seems to be the one thing that can make modernlife mysterious or marvellous to us.
The commonest thing is delightful if one only hide sit.
When I leave town now I never tell my people where I am going.
If I did, I would lose all my pleasure.
It is a silly habit, I daresay, but somehow it seems tobring a great deal of romance into one's life.
I suppose you think me awfully foolish about it?"
"Not at all," answered Lord Henry, "not at all, my dear Basil.
You seem to forget that I am married, and the onecharm of marriage is that it makes a life ofdeception absolutely necessary for both parties.
I never know where my wife is, and my wife never knows what I am doing.
When we meet—we do meet occasionally, when wedine out together, or go down to the Duke's—we telleach other the most absurd stories with the mostserious faces.
My wife is very good at it—much better, in fact, than I am.
She never gets confused over her dates, and I always do.
But when she does find me out, she makes no row at all.
I sometimes wish she would; but she merely laughs at me."
"I hate the way you talk about your married life,Harry," said Basil Hallward, strolling towards thedoor that led into the garden. "I believe that you are really a very good husband,but that you are thoroughly ashamed of your ownvirtues.
You are an extraordinary fellow.
You never say a moral thing, and you never do a wrong thing.
Your cynicism is simply a pose."
"Being natural is simply a pose, and the mostirritating pose I know," cried Lord Henry, laughing;and the two young men went out into the gardentogether, and ensconced themselves on a longbamboo seat that stood in the shade of a tall laurelbush.
The sunlight slipped over the polished leaves.
In the grass, white daisies were tremulous.
After a pause, Lord Henry pulled out his watch.
"I am afraid I must be going, Basil," he murmured, "and before I go, I insist on your answering aquestion I put to you some time ago."
"What is that?" said the painter, keeping his eyesfixed on the ground.
"You know quite well."
"I do not, Harry."
"Well, I will tell you what it is.
I want you to explain to me why you won't exhibitDorian Gray's picture.
I want the real reason."
"I told you the real reason."
"No, you did not.
You said it was because there was too much of yourself in it.
Now, that is childish."
"Harry," said Basil Hallward, looking him straight int he face, "every portrait that is painted with feelingis a portrait of the artist, not of the sitter. The sitter is merely the accident, the occasion.
It is not he who is revealed by the painter; it israther the painter who, on the coloured canvas,reveals himself.
The reason I will not exhibit this picture is that I amafraid that I have shown in it the secret of my ownsoul."
Lord Henry laughed.
"And what is that?" he asked.
"I will tell you," said Hallward; but an expression ofperplexity came over his face.
"I am all expectation, Basil," continued hiscompanion, glancing at him.
"Oh, there is really very little to tell, Harry,"answered the painter; "and I am afraid you will hardly understand it.
Perhaps you will hardly believe it."
Lord Henry smiled, and, leaning down, plucked a pink-petalled daisy from the grass, and examined it.
"I am quite sure I shall understand it," he replied,gazing intently at the little golden white-feathereddisk, "and as for believing things, I can believeanything, provided that it is quite incredible."
The wind shook some blossoms from the trees, andthe heavy lilac-blooms, with their clustering stars,moved to and fro in the languid air.
A grasshopper began to chirrup by the wall, and likea blue thread a long thin dragon-fly floated past onits brown gauze wings.
Lord Henry felt as if he could hear Basil Hallward'sheart beating, and wondered what was coming.
"The story is simply this," said the painter after some time. "Two months ago I went to a crush at Lady Brandon's.
You know we poor artists have to show ourselves insociety from time to time, just to remind the publicthat we are not savages.
With an evening coat and a white tie, as you told meonce, anybody, even a stockbroker, can gain areputation for being civilised.
Well, after I had been in the room about tenminutes, talking to huge over dressed dowagers andtedious Academicians, I suddenly became consciousthat someone was looking at me.
I turned halfway round, and saw Dorian Gray for the first time.
When our eyes met, I felt that I was growing pale.
A curious sensation of terror came over me. I knew that I had come face to face with someonewhose mere personality was so fascinating that, if Iallowed it to do so, it would absorb my whole nature,my whole soul, my very art itself.
I did not want any external influence in my life.
You know yourself, Harry, how independent I am by nature.
I have always been my own master; had at leastalways been so, till I met Dorian Gray.
Then—— but I don't know how to explain it to you.
Something seemed to tell me that I was on the vergeof a terrible crisis in my life.
I had a strange feeling that Fate had in store for meexquisite joys and exquisite sorrows.
I grew afraid, and turned to quit the room.
It was not conscience that made me do so; it was asort of cowardice.
I take no credit to myself for trying to escape."
"Conscience and cowardice are really the same things, Basil.
Conscience is the trade-name of the firm. That is all."
"I don't believe that, Harry, and I don't believe you do either.
However, whatever was my motive—and it may havebeen pride, for I used to be very proud—I certainlystruggled to the door.
There, of course, I stumbled against Lady Brandon.
'You are not going to run away so soon, Mr.Hallward?' she screamed out.
You know her curiously shrill voice?"
"Yes; she is a peacock in everything but beauty,"said Lord Henry, pulling the daisy to bits with hislong, nervous fingers.
"I could not get rid of her.
She brought me up to Royalties, and people withStars and Garters, and elderly ladles with gigantictiaras and parrot noses.
She spoke of me as her dearest friend. I had only met her once before, but she took it intoher head to lionise me.
I believe some picture of mine had made a greatsuccess at the time, at least had been chatteredabout in the penny newspapers, which is thenineteenth-century standard of immortality.
Suddenly I found myself face to face with the youngman whose personality had so strangely stirred me.
We were quite close, almost touching.
Our eyes met again.
It was reckless of me, but I asked Lady Brandon to introduce me to him.
Perhaps it was not so reckless, after all. It was simply inevitable. We would have spoken to each other without any introduction.
I am sure of that.
Dorian told me so afterwards.
He, too, felt that we were destined to know each other."
"And how did Lady Brandon describe this wonderfulyoung man?" asked his companion. "I know she goes in for giving a rapid précis of all her guests.
I remember her bringing me up to a truculent andred-faced old gentleman covered all over withorders and ribbons, and hissing into my ear, in atragic whisper which must have been perfectlyaudible to everybody in the room, the mostastounding details.
I simply fled.
I like to find out people for myself.
But Lady Brandon treats her guests exactly as anauctioneer treats his goods. She either explains them entirely away, or tells oneeverything about them except what one wants toknow."
"Poor Lady Brandon!
You are hard on her, Harry!" said Hall ward, listlessly.
"My dear fellow, she tried to found a salon, and onlysucceeded in opening a restaurant.
How could I admire her?
But tell me, what did she say about Mr. Dorian Gray?"
"Oh, something like, 'Charming boy—poor dear mother and I absolutely inseparable.
Quite forget what he does—afraid he—doesn't doanything—oh, yes, plays the piano—or is it the violin,dear Mr. Gray?'
Neither of us could help laughing, and we becamefriends at once."
"Laughter is not at all a bad beginning for afriendship, and it is far the best ending for one,"said the young lord, plucking another daisy.
Hallward shook his head.
"You don't understand what friendship is, Harry," hemurmured—"or what enmity is, for that matter.
You like everyone; that is to say, you are indifferentto everyone."
"How horribly unjust of you!" cried Lord Henry,tilting his hat back, and looking up at the littleclouds that, like ravelled skeins of glossy white silk,were drifting across the hollowed turquoise of thesummer sky. "Yes; horribly unjust of you.
I make a great difference between people.
I choose my friends for their good looks, myacquaintances for their good characters, and myenemies for their good intellects.
A man cannot be too careful in the choice of his enemies. I have not got one who is a fool.
They are all men of some intellectual power, andconsequently they all appreciate me.
Is that very vain of me?
I think it is rather vain."
"I should think it was, Harry.
But according to your category I must be merely an acquaintance."
"My dear old Basil, you are much more than an acquaintance."
"And much less than a friend.
A sort of brother, I suppose?"
"Oh, brothers!
I don't care for brothers.
My elder brother won't die, and my younger brothers seem never to do anything else."
"Harry!" exclaimed Hallward, frowning.
"My dear fellow, I am not quite serious.
But I can't help detesting my relations.
I suppose it comes from the fact that none of us canstand other people having the same faults asourselves.
I quite sympathise with the rage of the Englishdemocracy against what they call the vices of theupper orders.
The masses feel that drunkenness, stupidity, andimmorality should be their own special property,and that if anyone of us makes an ass of himself heis poaching on their preserves.
When poor Southwark got into the Divorce Court,their indignation was quite magnificent.
And yet I don't suppose that ten per cent. of theproletariat live correctly."
"I don't agree with a single word that you have said,and, what is more, Harry, I feel sure you don'teither."
Lord Henry stroked his pointed brown beard, andtapped the toe of his patent-leather boot with atasselled ebony cane.
"How English you are, Basil!
That is the second time you have made that observation.
If one puts forward an idea to a true Englishman—always a rash thing to do—he never dreams ofconsidering whether the idea is right or wrong.
The only thing he considers of any importance iswhether one believes it oneself.
Now, the value of an idea has nothing whatsoever todo with the sincerity of the man who expresses it.
Indeed, the probabilities are that the more insincerethe man is, the more purely intellectual will the ideabe, as in that case it will not be coloured by eitherhis wants, his desires, or his prejudices.
However, I don't propose to discuss politics,sociology, or metaphysics with you.
I like persons better than principles, and I likepersons with no principles better than anything elsein the world.
Tell me more about Mr. Dorian Gray.
How often do you see him?"
"Every day.
I couldn't be happy if I didn't see him every day.
He is absolutely necessary to me."
"How extraordinary!
I thought you would never care for anything but your art."
"He is all my art to me now," said the painter, gravely. "I sometimes think, Harry, that there are only twoeras of any importance in the world's history.
The first is the appearance of a new medium for art,and the second is the appearance of a newpersonality for art also.
What the invention of oil-painting was to theVenetians, the face of Antinoüs was to late Greeksculpture, and the face of Dorian Gray will some daybe to me.
It is not merely that I paint from him, draw from him,sketch from him.
Of course I have done all that.
But he is much more to me than a model or a sitter.
I won't tell you that I am dissatisfied with what Ihave done of him, or that his beauty is such that Artcannot express it.
There is nothing that Art cannot express, and I knowthat the work I have done, since I met Dorian Gray, isgood work, is the best work of my life.
But in some curious way—I wonder will youunderstand me?—his personality has suggested tome an entirely new manner in art, an entirely newmode of style.
I see things differently, I think of them differently.
I can now recreate life in a way that was hidden from me, before.
'A dream of form in days of thought:'—who is it who says that?
I forget; but it is what Dorian Gray has been to me.
The merely visible presence of this lad—for heseems to me little more than a lad, though he isreally over twenty—his merely visible presence—ah! I wonder can you realise all that that means?
Unconsciously he defines for me the lines of a freshschool, a school that is to have in it all the passion ofthe romantic spirit, all the perfection of the spiritthat is Greek.
The harmony of soul and body—how much that is!
We in our madness have separated the two, andhave invented a realism that is vulgar, an idealitythat is void.
Harry! if you only knew what Dorian Gray is to me!
You remember that landscape of mine, for whichAgnew offered me such a huge price, but which Iwould not part with?
It is one of the best things I have ever done.
And why is it so?
Because, while I was painting it, Dorian Gray sat beside me.
Some subtle influence passed from him to me, andfor the first time in my life I saw in the plainwoodland the wonder I had always looked for, andalways missed."
"Basil, this is extraordinary!
I must see Dorian Gray."
Hallward got up from the seat, and walked up and down the garden.
After some time he came back.
"Harry," he said, "Dorian Gray is to me simply a motive in art.
You might see nothing in him. I see everything in him.
He is never more present in my work than when noimage of him is there.
He is a suggestion, as I have said, of a new manner.
I find him in the curves of certain lines, in theloveliness and subtleties of certain colours.
That is all."
"Then why won't you exhibit his portrait?" asked Lord Henry.
"Because, without intending it, I have put into itsome expression of all this curious artistic idolatry,of which, of course, I have never cared to speak tohim.  He knows nothing about it.
He shall never know anything about it.
But the world might guess it; and I will not bare mysoul to their shallow prying eyes.
My heart shall never be put under their microscope.
There is too much of myself in the thing, Harry—toomuch of myself!"
"Poets are not so scrupulous as you are.
They know how useful passion is for publication.
Nowadays a broken heart will run to many editions."
"I hate them for it," cried Hallward. "An artist should create beautiful things, but should put nothing of his own life into them.
We live in an age when men treat art as if it weremeant to be a form of autobiography.
We have lost the abstract sense of beauty.
Some day I will show the world what it is; and forthat reason the world shall never see my portrait ofDorian Gray."
"I think you are wrong, Basil, but I won't argue with you.
It is only the intellectually lost who ever argue.
Tell me, is Dorian Gray very fond of you?"
The painter considered for a few moments.
"He likes me," he answered, after a pause; "I know he likes me.
Of course I flatter him dreadfully.
I find a strange pleasure in saying things to him thatI know I shall be sorry for having said.
As a rule, he is charming to me, and we sit in thestudio and talk of a thousand things.
Now and then, however, he is horribly thoughtless,and seems to take a real delight in giving me pain.
Then I feel, Harry, that I have given away my wholesoul to someone who treats it as if it were a flowerto put in his coat, a bit of decoration to charm hisvanity, an ornament for a summer's day."
"Days in summer, Basil, are apt to linger," murmured Lord Henry. "Perhaps you will tire sooner than he will.
It is a sad thing to think of, but there is no doubtthat Genius lasts longer than Beauty.
That accounts for the fact that we all take suchpains to over-educate ourselves.
In the wild struggle for existence, we want to havesomething that endures, and so we fill our mindswith rubbish and facts, in the silly hope of keepingour place.
The thoroughly well-informed man—that is the modern ideal.
And the mind of the thoroughly well-informed manis a dreadful thing.
It is like a bric-à-brac shop, all monsters and dust,with everything priced above its proper value.
I think you will tire first, all the same.
Some day you will look at your friend, and he willseem to you to be a little out of drawing, or youwon't like his tone of colour, or something.
You will bitterly reproach him in your own heart,and seriously think that he has behaved very badlyto you.
The next time he calls, you will be perfectly cold andindifferent.
It will be a great pity, for it will alter you.
What you have told me is quite a romance, aromance of art one might call it, and the worst ofhaving a romance of any kind is that it leaves one sounromantic."
"Harry, don't talk like that.
As long as I live, the personality of Dorian Gray willdominate me.
You can't feel what I feel. You change too often."
"Ah, my dear Basil, that is exactly why I can feel it.
Those who are faithful know only the trivial side oflove: it is the faithless who know love's tragedies."
And Lord Henry struck a light on a dainty silver case,and began to smoke a cigarette with a self-conscious and satisfied air, as if he had summed upthe world in a phrase.
There was a rustle of chirruping sparrows in thegreen lacquer leaves of the ivy, and the blue cloud-shadows chased themselves across the grass likeswallows.
How pleasant it was in the garden!
And how delightful other people's emotions were!—much more delightful than their ideas, it seemedto him. One's own soul, and the passions of one's friends—those were the fascinating things in life.
He pictured to himself with silent amusement thetedious luncheon that he had missed by staying solong with Basil Hallward.
Had he gone to his aunt's he would have been sureto have met Lord Goodbody there, and the wholeconversation would have been about the feeding ofthe poor, and the necessity for model lodging-houses.
Each class would have preached the importance ofthose virtues, for whose exercise there was nonecessity in their own lives. The rich would have spoken on the value of thrift,and the idle grown eloquent over the dignity oflabour.
It was charming to have escaped all that!
As he thought of his aunt, an idea seemed to strike him.
He turned to Hallward, and said,
"My dear fellow, I have just remembered."
"Remembered what, Harry?"
"Where I heard the name of Dorian Gray."
"Where was it?" asked Hallward, with a slight frown.
"Don't look so angry, Basil.
It was at my aunt, Lady Agatha's.
She told me she had discovered a wonderful youngman, who was going to help her in the East End, andthat his name was Dorian Gray.
I am bound to state that she never told me he was good-looking.
Women have no appreciation of good looks; at least,good women have not.
She said that he was very earnest, and had abeautiful nature. I at once pictured to myself a creature withspectacles and lank hair, horribly freckled, andtramping about on huge feet.
I wish I had known it was your friend."
"I am very glad you didn't, Harry."
"Why?"
"I don't want you to meet him."
"You don't want me to meet him?"
"No."
"Mr. Dorian Gray is in the studio, sir," said thebutler, coming into the garden.
"You must introduce me now," cried Lord Henry, laughing.
The painter turned to his servant, who stoodblinking in the sunlight.
"Ask Mr. Gray to wait, Parker: I shall be in in a few moments."
The man bowed, and went up the walk.
Then he looked at Lord Henry.
"Dorian Gray is my dearest friend," he said. "He has a simple and a beautiful nature. Your aunt was quite right in what she said of him.
Don't spoil him.
Don't try to influence him.
Your influence would be bad.
The world is wide, and has many marvello us people in it.
Don't take away from me the one person who givesto my art whatever charm it possesses; my life as anartist depends on him.
Mind, Harry, I trust you."
He spoke very slowly, and the words seemed wrungout of him almost against his will.
"What nonsense you talk!" said Lord Henry, smiling,and, taking Hallward by the arm, he almost led himinto the house.Er Tostik meets Bapy, the Snake King in the underground kingdom
When it did, the earth cracked under horse.
Er Tostik and his horse fell down under the ground.
Shalkuyryk spoke as a human.
Now we are in the Underground Kingdom of bapy, the Snake King.
His palace should be somewhere nearby.
When you see him, please leave me and go alone inside the palace.
Two black snakes guard the entrance.
They will rattle and attack you, but you should not let them scare you.
They are slaves of king Bapy.
When you pass the entrance and come into the room, two grey snakes will come to you.
They will crawl to your chest and leave trough your high boots.
These snakes are the son and daughter of king Bapy.
Do not let them scare you, either.
When you sit down on the floor, two giant yellow snakes will come up to you, rattling.
They are king Bapy and his Wife.
You should behave bravely, otherwise they will have no respect for you, and we will never be able to find a way back to the surface.
Three Dzhigits at a Magic Stone
The eldest brother threw the golden eagle high in the sky.
The eagle climbed to the top of the sky and dropped like lightning to a fox.
Quickly, the dzhigits rode their horses to where the golden eagle landed. 
They were surprised to see that there was no fox. 
Instead, the golden eagle sat upon a stone.
It was not a regular stone.
A skilled crafts-image was an inscription.
The one who finds this stone and brings it to me will be my master and my husband.
The dzhigits stood silent and motionless before the wonderful stone.
They immediately fell in love with the girl who looked at them from the stone, and their love for her grew with each passing moment.
The eldest brother said, “What should we do?”
All the three of us discovered this wonderful stone at the same time.
The middle brother  said
Let us cast lots.
Let fate decide which of us should receive her beauty.
The youngest brother said
Dear brothers, we found this wonderful stone together.
Let us look for the beauty together, too.
If we have luck, and we manage to see her in reality, let her choose husband on her own.
Once there was a Prince. 
He wanted to marry a real Princess.
So he traveled through all the world to find her, and everywhere things went wrong. 
There were Princesses aplenty.
But how was he to know whether they were real Princesses
So he came home again and was unhappy.
One evening a terrible storm blew up. 
It lightened and thundered and rained. 
It was really frightful!
In the midst of it all came a knocking at the town gate. 
The old King went to open it.
Before him stood a girl.
She was in all that rain and wind. 
Water streamed from her hair down her clothes into her shoes, and ran out at the heels.
Yet she claimed to be a real Princess.
"We'll soon find that out," the old Queen thought to herself. 
She stripped back the bedclothes, and put just one pea in the bottom of the bed. 
Then she took twenty mattresses and piled them on the pea.
Then she took twenty eiderdown feather beds and piled them on the mattresses. 
Up on top of all these the Princess was to spend the night.
In the morning they asked her, "Did you sleep well?"
" Oh!" said the Princess. 
No. 
I scarcely slept at all. 
Heaven knows what's in that bed. 
I lay on something so hard that I'm black and blue all over. 
It was simply terrible.
They could see she was a real Princess.
She had felt one pea all the way through twenty mattresses and twenty more feather beds.
Such sensitivity, tenderness characteristic of only a true princess.
So the Prince made haste to marry her, because he knew he had found a real Princess.
As for the pea, they put it in the museum. 
There it's still to be seen, unless somebody has taken it.
There, that's a true story.
Once upon a time there lived a pretty girl.
Her mother was excessively fond of her.
Her grandmother doted on her still more.
Once her grandmother gave for her  little red riding hood for her birthday.
It suited the girl so extremely well that everybody called her Little Red Riding Hood. 
One day her mother, having made some cakes, said to her: “Go, my dear, and see how your grandmother is doing”.
I hear she has been very ill.
Take her a cake, and this little pot of butter.
Little Red Riding Hood set out immediately to go to her grandmother. 
As she was going through the wood, she met with a wolf, who had a very great mind to eat her up
But he dared not, because of some woodcutters working nearby in the forest.
Little Red Riding Hood did not know that it was dangerous to stay and talk to a wolf.
When she is going through wood, the wolf pops up front of her.
He asked her where she was going.
I am going to see my grandmother and carry her a cake and a little pot of butter from my mother. 
"Does she live far off?” said the wolf. 
My grandmother?
It is beyond that mill you see there, at the first house in the village. 
At that time nearby there loggers cut down trees.
The wolf hear the voice of loggers and do not touch the girl.
Well, and I’ll go and see her too.
I’ll go this way and go you that.
We shall see who will be there first. 
The wolf ran as fast as he could, taking the shortest path.
The little girl took a roundabout way,
Along the way, she gathering bouquets of flowers.
It was not long before the wolf arrived at the old woman’s house.
He knocked at the door.
Tap, tap. 
Who’s there? 
Your grandchild, Little Red Riding Hood, who has brought you a cake and a little pot of butter sent you by mother. 
The good grandmother, who was in bed, because she was somewhat ill, cried out, "Pull the string, and the latch will go up. 
The wolf pulled the string , and the door opened.
Then he immediately fell upon the grandmother and ate her up in a moment, for it been more than three days since he had eaten.
He then shut the door and got into the grandmother’s bed, expecting Little Red Riding Hood.
Some time afterwards Little Red Riding Hood came and knocked at the door.
Tap, tap. 
Who’s there?
Little Red Riding Hood, hearing the big voice of the wolf, was at first afraid.
Then, she mind that  “grandmother had a cold and her voice might have been changed".
    It is your grandchild Little Red Riding Hood, who has brought you a cake and a little pot of butter mother sends you. 
The wolf cried out to her, softening his voice as much as he could:
"Pull the string, and the latch will go up.”
Little Red Riding Hood pulled the string, and the door opened.   
The wolf said to her, "Put the cake and the little pot of butter upon the stool, and come sit on the bed with me.” 
Little Red Riding Hood sat on the bed.
She was greatly amazed to see how her grandmother looked in her nightclothes, and said to her: "Grandmother, what big arms you have!” 
"All the better to hug you with, my dear.” 
"Grandmother, what big legs you have!” 
"All the better to run with, my child.” 
"Grandmother, what big ears you have!” 
"All the better to hear with, my child.” 
"Grandmother, what big eyes you have!” 
"All the better to see with, my child.” 
"Grandmother, what big teeth you have got!” 
"All the better to eat you up with.” 
And, saying these words, this wicked wolf fell upon Little Red Riding Hood, and ate her all up. 
At that moment the woodcutters were passing by the house.
They heard the voice of wolf, rushed to the house and killed the wolf.
And out came Little Red Riding Hood and her grandmother.
They were safe and sound and very happy!
Mamai in the village of nomadic peri
I mounred Zhai-Dakker, my fastest horse, and set off to Kubazhon.
When I arrived there and came to certain hill, I saw something very strange.
Around a well sat round, white nomad huts. 
Playing next to the huts were girls as white as diamonds.
“This is magic,” I thought.
“There used to be nothing here before.
Where has all this come from?’’
I stood motionless and bewildered.
If I go right there, I might get killed.
I will call on my people, and then I will go there.
Then I thought, “But I am a mighty man, and it is a shame to be scared to go there alone.”
As soon as I came among them, they surrounded me and began to shout, “A fiancé has come! A fiancé has come!”. 
Some of them held my horse , others pilled at my beard and still others pushed my sides.
And all the time they continued to shout , “A fiancé! A fiancé!”
How Aldar Kose exchanged his worn-out   сoat  for a new fur coat
Pilgrims stopped their horses and greeted each other.
The rich man shivered with cold in his fox-fur coat.
Aldar Kose put on his hat at a jaunty angle because he was in direct sunshine on a hot summer day.
“Aren’t you cold?” 
“You are cold in your fur coat, and I am hot in mine,”
“How can you feel hot in your coat?” the rich man asked.
“Can’t you see that?”
Did not you see?
“That’s right. 
Cold wind comes in one hole and successfully leaves trough the other, while I remain warm.”
I would be real warm if I could wear the rich man’s fur coat, thought the cunning fellow Aldar Kose.
“Please sell me your coat,” the rich man asked Aldar Kose.
“No way! I will freeze immediately without my coat.”
No, you will not freeze.
I will give you my fox fur coat in exchange for yours
It is warm, too.
Aldar Kose pretended not to listen to such a silly offer.
Meanwhile, he admired the rich man’s warm fur.
I will give you my fur coat and additionally, some money.”
I do not need any money.
But if you give me your horse I will consider your offer.
The rich man was happy to hear this and he agreed.
He took off his warm fur coat and gave Aldar Kose his horse, too.
Aldar Kose put on the fox fur coat, mounted the rich man’s fast horse and rode off like the wind.
Many years passed. 
Sarsenbai lived in a village and he followed Altyn kyz like a thread follows the needle.
They were happy to share labor and leisure, sorrow and joy.
Sarsenbai was the most brave and skillful man on their whole plain, and Altyn kyz was the most tender, beautiful girl in this whole world.
When they came of age and grew up, they got married and enjoyed their life even more.
Soon they had a first-born child.
A son who made his father proud and his mother quite happy.
One day Sarsenbai rested upon sweet village weed after the finished his regular work.
His son sat on his chest.
Sarsenbai was happy and smiling, and he said joyfully to Altyn kyz, who was nearby
“See, my wonderful dream I bought for a penny from a peddler in the caravansary
Came true look, I lie on a precious bed made of the holy ground of my Motherland.
My beloved Altyn-kyz, the sunshine of my heart, is near me. 
Our sweet son, golden moonshine, our first-born plays on my chest.
No king can happier than me at this moment!
A rumor came across the plain that the king wanted the bravest and most skillful man to marry his daughter.
Potential fiancées set off for the King’s camp.
Two brothers, the eldest and the middle brother, began to prepare for the journey.
The youngest brother wanted to go, too, but his two elder brothers did not want to take him.
“No way,” they said to their younger brother.
So the youngest brother stayed at home.
He took a single black hair and burnt it.
A black horse appeared immediately.
The younger brother quickly changed his clothes for the rich attire attached to the saddle.
He mounted the horse, touched it twice with a whip and quickly overtook his brothers.
The king ordered seven houses put one upon the other, and his daughter climbed to the top one and sat by a window.
The King gave her a ring and declared for everybody to hear,   “The Dzhigit who snatches the ring from my daughter will be my son-in-law.”
The King’s daughter put the ring on Dzhigit’s finger and told him to cover it with a cloth so that would see it and steal it.
The wedding day arrived.
Many people came to enjoy the wedding.
They began to look for the one who had the ring.
All was in vain.
Then the King’s daughter called on the youngest brother.
He appeared in rags that covered one of his fingers.
When he removed the rag from his finger, the King and everybody there saw the ring.
Thus, the King married his daughter to the youngest brother.
Old wolf and another old she-wolf came up to man with fangs glittering.
‘This is a fiancé of your daughter,” explained the yellow she-wolf.
“You ate the meat of his horses throughout the entire winter.”
The old wolves backed up and took their regular places.
The yellow she-wolf showed the Dzhigit to a third den.
A meal was being served there.
“Help yourself,” said the she-wolf. 
When night fell, the grey she-wolf made a bed for the Dzhigit and left him alone.
Some time passed and she came back with a beautiful white she-wolf.
“This is your fiancée,” she said to the Dzhigit, and then left.
Immediately, the white she – wolf threw off her wolf skin and the Dzhigit saw a perfect beauty.
There came a soldier marching down the high road-one.
He had his knapsack on his back and his sword at his side.
He came home from the wars.
On the road he met a witch.
She was ugly and unpleasant.
"Good evening, soldier!" witch said.
The witch pointed to tree nearby them.
Climb to the top of the trunk and you'll find a hole.
You notice through the hollow that inside of tree than large cave.
It has three rooms in a cave.
Each room has a huge chest and it was guarded by dogs.
I'll give you my apron to seat a dogs in it.
You can take money from chest.
You shall bring me my remaining tinder-box.
I'll tie a rope around your middle.
When you call me I can pull you up again.
"What would I do deep down under that tree?" the soldier wanted to know.
"Fetch money," the witch said.
Listen.
When you touch bottom you'll find yourself in a great hall.
It is very bright there, because more than a hundred lamps are burning
By the light you will see three doors.
Each door has a key in it, so you can open them all.
If you walk into the first room, you'll see a large chest in the middle of the floor.
On it sits a dog, and his eyes are as big as saucers.
But don't worry about that.
I'll give you my blue checked apron to spread out on the floor.
Snatch up that dog and set him on my apron.
Then you can open the chest and take out as many pieces of money as you please.
They are all copper.
But if silver suits you better, then go into the next room.
There sits a dog and his eyes are as big as mill wheels.
But don't you care about that.
Set the dog on my apron while you change your pockets with silver.
Maybe you'd rather have gold.
You can, you know.
You can have all the gold you can carry if you go into the third room.
The only hitch is that there on the money-chest sits a dog.
Each of his eyes is as big as the Round Tower of Copenhagen.
But never you mind how fierce he looks.
Just set him on my apron and he'll do you no harm.
"That suits me," said the soldier.
But what do you get out of all this, you old witch?
I suppose that you want your share.
"No indeed," said the witch.
I don't want a penny of it.
All I ask is for you to fetch me an old tinderbox.
My grandmother forgot the last time she was down there.
"Good," said the soldier.
Tie the rope around me.
"Here it is," said the witch, "and here's my blue checked apron."
The soldier climbed up to the hole in the tree.
He run down into the great hall where the hundreds of lamps were burning, as the witch had said.
He threw open the first door.
Ugh!
There sat a dog glaring at him with eyes as big as saucers.
"You're a nice fellow," the soldier said,
He shifted him to the witch's apron and took all the coppers that his pockets would hold.
He shut up the chest, set the dog back on it.
Alas and alack!
There sat the dog with eyes as big as mill wheels.
Don't you look at me like that.
The soldier set him on the witch's apron.
When he saw the chest brimful of silver, he threw away all his coppers and filled both his pockets and knapsack with silver alone.
Then he went into the third room.
Oh, what a horrible sight to see!
The dog in there really did have eyes as big as the Round Tower.
He rolled them they spun like wheels.
"Good evening," the soldier said, and saluted, for such a dog he had never seen before.
But on second glance he thought to himself, "This won't do."
So he lifted the dog down to the floor, and threw open the chest.
What a sight!
Here was gold and to spare.
He could buy out all Copenhagen with it.
He could buy all the cakes, all the tin soldiers, whips and rocking horses there are in the world.
Yes, there was really money!
In short order the soldier got rid of all the silver coins he had stuffed in his pockets and knapsack, to put gold in their place.
Yes sir, he crammed all his pockets, his knapsack, his cap, and his boots so full.
Now he was made of money.
Putting the dog back on the chest he banged out the door and called up through the hollow tree.
Pull me up now, you old witch.
"Have you got the tinderbox?" asked the witch.
"Confound the tinderbox," the soldier shouted.
I clean forgot it.
When he fetched it, the witch hauled him up.
There he stood on the highroad again, with his pockets, boots, knapsack and cap full of gold.
"What do you want with the tinderbox?" he asked the old witch.
"None of your business," she told him.
"You've had your money, so hand over my tinder box."
"Nonsense," said the soldier.
I'll take out my sword and I'll cut your head off if you don't tell me at once what you want with it.
"I won't," the witch screamed at him.
So he cut her head off.
There she lay!
But he tied all his money in her apron, slung it over his shoulder, stuck the tinderbox in his pocket, and struck out for town.
It was a splendid town.
He took the best rooms at the best inn.
He ordered all the good things he liked to eat.
Next morning he bought boots worthy of him, and the best clothes.
Now that he had turned out to be such a fashionable gentleman.
People told him all about the splendors of their town, all about their King, and what a pretty Princess he had for a daughter.
"Where can I see her?" the soldier inquired.
"You can't see her at all," everyone said.
She lives in a great copper castle inside all sorts of walls and towers.
Only the King can come in or go out of it, for it's been foretold that the Princess will marry a common soldier.
"I'd like to see her just the same," the soldier thought.
But there was no way to manage it.
Now he lived a merry life.Of the inhabitants of Lilliput; their learning, laws, and customs; the manner of educating their children.
The author’s way of living in that country.
His vindication of a great lady.
ALTHOUGH I INTEND to leave the description of this empire to a particular treatise, yet, in the mean time, I am content to gratify the curious reader with some general ideas.
As the common size of the natives is somewhat under six inches high, so there is an exact proportion in all other animals, as well as plants and trees: for instance, the tallest horses and oxen are between four and five inches in height, the sheep an inch and half, more or less: their geese about the bigness of a sparrow, and so the several gradations downwards till you come to the smallest, which to my sight, were almost invisible; but nature has adapted the eyes of the Lilliputians to all objects proper for their view: they see with great exactness, but at no great distance.
And, to show the sharpness of their sight towards objects that are near, I have been much pleased with observing a cook pulling a lark, which was not so large as a common fly; and a young girl threading an invisible needle with invisible silk.
Their tallest trees are about seven feet high: I mean some of those in the great royal park, the tops whereof I could but just reach with my fist clenched.
The other vegetables are in the same proportion; but this I leave to the reader’s imagination.
I shall say but little at present of their learning, which, for many ages, has flourished in all its branches among them: but their manner of writing is very peculiar, being neither from the left to the right, like the Europeans, nor from the right to the left, like the Arabians, nor from up to down, like the Chinese, but aslant, from one corner of the paper to the other, like ladies in England.
They bury their dead with their heads directly downward, because they hold an opinion, that in eleven thousand moons they are all to rise again; in which period the earth (which they conceive to be flat) will turn upside down, and by this means they shall, at their resurrection, be found ready standing on their feet.
The learned among them confess the absurdity of this doctrine; but the practice still continues, in compliance to the vulgar.
There are some laws and customs in this empire very peculiar; and if they were not so directly contrary to those of my own dear country, I should be tempted to say a little in their justification.
It is only to be wished they were as well executed.
The first I shall mention, relates to informers.
All crimes against the state, are punished here with the utmost severity; but, if the person accused makes his innocence plainly to appear upon his trial, the accuser is immediately put to an ignominious death; and out of his goods or lands the innocent person is quadruply recompensed for the loss of his time, for the danger he underwent, for the hardship of his imprisonment, and for all the charges he has been at in making his defence; or, if that fund be deficient, it is largely supplied by the crown.
The emperor also confers on him some public mark of his favour, and proclamation is made of his innocence through the whole city.
They look upon fraud as a greater crime than theft, and therefore seldom fail to punish it with death; for they allege, that care and vigilance, with a very common understanding, may preserve a man’s goods from thieves, but honesty has no defence against superior cunning; and, since it is necessary that there should be a perpetual intercourse of buying and selling, and dealing upon credit, where fraud is permitted and connived at, or has no law to punish it, the honest dealer is always undone, and the knave gets the advantage.
I remember, when I was once interceding with the emperor for a criminal who had wronged his master of a great sum of money, which he had received by order and ran away with; and happening to tell his majesty, by way of extenuation, that it was only a breach of trust, the emperor thought it monstrous in me to offer as a defence the greatest aggravation of the crime; and truly I had little to say in return, farther than the common answer, that different nations had different customs; for, I confess, I was heartily ashamed.* *An act of parliament has been since passed by which some breaches of trust have been made capital.
Although we usually call reward and punishment the two hinges upon which all government turns, yet I could never observe this maxim to be put in practice by any nation except that of Lilliput.
Whoever can there bring sufficient proof, that he has strictly observed the laws of his country for seventythree moons, has a claim to certain privileges, according to his quality or condition of life, with a proportionable sum of money out of a fund appropriated for that use: he likewise acquires the title of Snilpall, or legal, which is added to his name, but does not descend to his posterity.
And these people thought it a prodigious defect of policy among us, when I told them that our laws were enforced only by penalties, without any mention of reward.
It is upon this account that the image of Just ice, intheir courts of judicature, is formed with six eyes, two before, as many behind, and on each side one, to signify circumspection; with a bag of gold open in her right hand, and a sword sheathed in her left, to show she is more disposed to reward than to punish.
In choosing persons for all employments, they have more regard to good morals than to great abilities; for, since government is necessary to mankind, they believe, that the common size of human understanding is fitted to some station or other; and that Providence never intended to make the management of public affairs a mystery to be comprehended only by a few persons of sublime genius, of which there seldom are three born in an age: but they suppose truth, justice, temperance, and the like, to be in every man’s power; the practice of which virtues, assisted by experience and a good intention, would qualify any man for the service of his country, except where a course of study is required.
But they thought the want of moral virtues was so far from being supplied by superior endowments of the mind, that employments could never be put into such dangerous hands as those of persons so qualified; and, at least, that the mistakes committed by ignorance, in a virtuous disposition, would never be of such fatal consequence to the public weal, as the practices of a man, whose inclinations led him to be corrupt, and who had great abilities to manage, to multiply, and defend his corruptions.
In like manner, the disbelief of a Divine Providence renders a man incapable of holding any public station; for, since kings avow themselves to be the deputies of Providence, the Lilliputians think nothing can be more absurd than for a prince to employ such men as disown the authority under which he acts.
In relating these and the following laws, I would only be understood to mean the original institutions, and not the most scandalous corruptions, into which these people are fallen by the degenerate nature of man.
For, as to that infamous practice of acquiring great employments by dancing on the ropes, or badges of favour and distinction by leaping over sticks and creeping under them, the reader is to observe, that they were first introduced by the grandfather of the emperor now reigning, and grew to the present height by the gradual increase of party and faction.
Ingratitude is among them a capital crime, as we read it to have been in some other countries: for they reason thus; that whoever makes ill returns to his benefactor, must needs be a common enemy to the rest of mankind, from whom he has received no obligation, and therefore such a man is not fit to live.
Their notions relating to the duties of parents and children differ extremely from ours.
For, since the conjunction of male and female is founded upon the great law of nature, in order to propagate and continue the species, the Lilliputians will needs have it, that men and women are joined together, like other animals, by the motives of concupiscence; and that their tenderness towards their young proceeds from the like natural principle: for which reason they will never allow that a child is under any obligation to his father for begetting him, or to his mother for bringing him into the world; which, considering the miseries of human life, was neither a benefit in itself, nor intended so by his parents, whose thoughts, in their love encounters, were otherwise employed.
Upon these, and the like reasonings, their opinion is, that parents are the last of all others to be trusted with the education of their own children; and therefore they have in every town public nurseries, where all parents, except cottagers and labourers, are obliged to send their infants of both sexes to be reared and educated, when they come to the age of twenty moons, at which time they are supposed to have some rudiments of docility.
These schools are of several kinds, suited to different qualities, and both sexes.
They have certain professors well skilled in preparing children for such a condition of life as befits the rank of their parents, and their own capacities, as well as inclinations.
I shall first say something of the male nurseries, and then of the female.
The nurseries for males of noble or eminent birth, are provided with grave and learned professors, and their several deputies.
The clothes and food of the children are plain and simple.
They are bred up in the principles of honour, justice, courage, modesty, clemency, religion, and love of their country; they are always employed in some business, except in the times of eating and sleeping, which are very short, and two hours for diversions consisting of bodily exercises.
They are dressed by men till four years of age, and then are obliged to dress themselves, although their quality be ever so great; and the women attendant, who are aged proportionably to ours at fifty, perform only the most menial offices.
They are never suffered to converse with servants, but go together in smaller or greater numbers to take their diversions, and always in the presence of a professor, or one of his deputies; whereby they avoid those early bad impressions of folly and vice, to which our children are subject.
Their parents are suffered to see them only twice a year; the visit is to last but an hour; they are allowed to kiss the child at meeting and parting; but a professor, who always stands by on those occasions, will not suffer them to whisper, or use any fondling expressions, or bring any presents of toys, sweetmeats, and the like.
The pension from each family for the education and entertainment of a child, upon failure of due payment, is levied by the emperor’s officers.
The nurseries for children of ordinary gentlemen, merchants, traders, and handicrafts, are managed proportionably after the same manner; only those designed for trades are put out apprentices at eleven years old, whereas those of persons of quality continue in their exercises till fifteen, which answers to twenty-one with us: but the confinement is gradually lessened for the last three years.
In the female nurseries, the young girls of quality are educated much like the males, only they are dressed by orderly servants of their own sex; but always in the presence of a professor or deputy, till they come to dress themselves, which is at five years old.
And if it be found that these nurses ever presume to entertain the girls with frightful or foolish stories, or the common follies practised by chambermaids among us, they are publicly whipped thrice about the city, imprisoned for a year, and banished for life to the most desolate part of the country.
Thus the young ladies are as much ashamed of being cowards and fools as the men, and despise all personal ornaments, beyond decency and cleanliness: neither did I perceive any difference in their education made by their difference of sex, only that the exercises of the females were not altogether so robust; and that some rules were given them relating to domestic life, and a smaller compass of learning was enjoined them: for their maxim is, that among peoples of quality, a wife should be always a reasonable and agreeable companion, because she cannot always be young.
When the girls are twelve years old, which among them is the marriageable age, their parents or guardians take them home, with great expressions of gratitude to the professors, and seldom without tears of the young lady and her companions.
In the nurseries of females of the meaner sort, the children are instructed in all kinds of works proper for their sex, and their several degrees: those intended for apprentices are dismissed at seven years old, the rest are kept to eleven.
The meaner families who have children at these nurseries, are obliged, besides their annual pension, which is as low as possible, to return to the steward of the nursery a small monthly share of their gettings, to be a portion for the child; and therefore all parents are limited in their expenses by the law.
For the Lilliputians think nothing can be more unjust, than for people, in subservience to their own appetites, to bring children into the world, and leave the burthen of supporting them on the public.
As to persons of quality, they give security to appropriate a certain sum for each child, suitable to their condition; and these funds are always managed with good husbandry and the most exact justice.
The cottagers and labourers keep their children at home, their business being only to till and cultivate the earth, and therefore their education is of little consequence to the public: but the old and diseased among them, are supported by hospitals; for begging is a trade unknown in this empire.
And here it may, perhaps, divert the curious reader, to give some account of my domestics, and my manner of living in this country, during a residence of nine months, and thirteen days.
Having a head mechanically turned, and being likewise forced by necessity, I had made for myself a table and chair convenient enough, out of the largest trees in the royal park.
Two hundred sempstresses were employed to make me shirts, and linen for my bed and table, all of the strongest and coarsest kind they could get; which, however, they were forced to quilt together in several folds, for the thickest was some degrees finer than lawn.
Their linen is usually three inches wide, and three feet make a piece.
The sempstresses took my measure as I lay on the ground, one standing at my neck, and another at my mid-leg, with a strong cord extended, that each held by the end, while a third measured the length of the cord with a rule of an inch long.
Then they measured my right thumb, and desired no more; for by a mathematical computation, that twice round the thumb is once round the wrist, and so on to the neck and the waist, and by the help of my old shirt, which I displayed on the ground before them for a pattern, they fitted me exactly.
Three hundred tailors were employed in the same manner to make me clothes; but they had another contrivance for taking my measure.
I kneeled down, and they raised a ladder from the ground to my neck; upon this ladder one of them mounted, and let fall a plumb-line from my collar to the floor, which just answered the length of my coat: but my waist and arms I measured myself.
When my clothes were finished, which was done in my house (for the largest of theirs would not have been able to hold them), they looked like the patch-work made by the ladies in England, only that mine were all of a colour.
I had three hundred cooks to dress my victuals, in little convenient huts built about my house, where they and their families lived, and prepared me two dishes a-piece.
I took up twenty waiters in my hand, and placed them on the table: a hundred more attended below on the ground, some with dishes of meat, and some with barrels of wine and other liquors slung on their shoulders; all which the waiters above drew up, as I wanted, in a very ingenious manner, by certain cords, as we draw the bucket up a well in Europe.
A dish of their meat was a good mouthful, and a barrel of their liquor a reasonable draught.
Their mutton yields to ours, but their beef is excellent.
I have had a sirloin so large, that I have been forced to make three bites of it; but this is rare.
My servants were astonished to see me eat it, bones and all, as in our country we do the leg of a lark.
Their geese and turkeys I usually ate at a mouthful, and I confess they far exceed ours.
Of their smaller fowl I could take up twenty or thirty at the end of my knife.
One day his imperial majesty, being informed of my way of living, desired “that himself and his royal consort, with the young princes of the blood of both sexes, might have the happiness,” as he was pleased to call it, “of dining with me.”
They came accordingly, and I placed them in chairs of state, upon my table, just over against me, with their guards about them.
Flimnap, the lord high treasurer, attended there likewise with his white staff; and I observed he often looked on me with a sour countenance, which I would not seem to regard, but ate more than usual, in honour to my dear country, as well as to fill the court with admiration.
Flimnap, the lord high treasurer, attended there likewise with his white staff; and I observed he often looked on me with a sour countenance, which I would not seem to regard, but ate more than usual, in honour to my dear country, as well as to fill the court with admiration.
That minister had always been my secret enemy, though he outwardly caressed me more than was usual to the moroseness of his nature.
He represented to the emperor “the low condition of his treasury; that he was forced to take up money at a great discount; that exchequer bills would not circulate under nine per cent. below par; that I had cost his majesty above a million and a half of sprugs” (their greatest gold coin, about the bigness of a spangle) “and, upon the whole, that it would be advisable in the emperor to take the first fair occasion of dismissing me.”
I am here obliged to vindicate the reputation of an excellent lady, who was an innocent sufferer upon my account.
The treasurer took a fancy to be jealous of his wife, from the malice of some evil tongues, who informed him that her grace had taken a violent affection for my person; and the court scandal ran for some time, that she once came privately to my lodging.
This I solemnly declare to be a most infamous falsehood, without any grounds, further than that her grace was pleased to treat me with all innocent marks of freedom and friendship.
I own she came often to my house, but always publicly, nor ever without three more in the coach, who were usually her sister and young daughter, and some particular acquaintance; but this was common to many other ladies of the court.
And I still appeal to my servants round, whether they at any time saw a coach at my door, without knowing what persons were in it.
On those occasions, when a servant had given me notice, my custom was to go immediately to the door, and, after paying my respects, to take up the coach and two horses very carefully in my hands (for, if there were six horses, the postillion always unharnessed four,) and place them on a table, where I had fixed a movable rim quite round, of five inches high, to prevent accidents.
And I have often had four coaches and horses at once on my table, full of company, while I sat in my chair, leaning my face towards them; and when I was engaged with one set, the coachmen would gently drive the others round my table.
I have passed many an afternoon very agreeably in these conversations.
But I defy the treasurer, or his two informers (I will name them, and let them make the best of it) Clustril and Drunlo, to prove that any person ever came to me incognito, except the secretary Reldresal, who was sent by express command of his imperial majesty, as I have before related.
I should not have dwelt so long upon this particular, if it had not been a point wherein the reputation of a great lady is so nearly concerned, to say nothing of my own; though I then had the honour to be a nardac, which the treasurer himself is not; for all the world knows, that he is only a glumglum, a title inferior by one degree, as that of a marquis is to a duke in England; yet I allow he preceded me in right of his post.
These false informations, which I afterwards came to the knowledge of by an accident not proper to mention, made the treasurer show his lady for some time an ill countenance, and me a worse; and although he was at last undeceived and reconciled to her, yet I lost all credit with him, and found my interest decline very fast with the emperor himself, who was, indeed, too much governed by that favourite.
The author, being informed of a design to accuse him of high-treason, makes his escape to Blefuscu. His reception there.
BEFORE I PROCEED to give an account of my leaving this kingdom, it may be proper to inform the reader of a private intrigue which had been for two months forming against me.
I had been hitherto, all my life, a stranger to courts, for which I was unqualified by the meanness of my condition.
I had indeed heard and read enough of the dispositions of great princes and ministers, but never expected to have found such terrible effects of them, in so remote a country, governed, as I thought, by very different maxims from those in Europe.
When I was just preparing to pay my attendance on the emperor of Blefuscu, a considerable person at court (to whom I had been very serviceable, at a time when he lay under the highest displeasure of his imperial majesty) came to my house very privately at night, in a close chair, and, without sending his name, desired admittance.
The chairmen were dismissed; I put the chair, with his lordship in it, into my coat-pocket: and, giving orders to a trusty servant, to say I was indisposed and gone to sleep, I fastened the door of my house, placed the chair on the table, according to my usual custom, and sat down by it.
After the common salutations were over, observing his lordship’s countenance full of concern, and inquiring into the reason, he desired “I would hear him with patience, in a matter that highly concerned my honour and my life.”
His speech was to the following effect, for I took notes of it as soon as he left me:–
“You are to know,” said he, “that several committees of council have been lately called, in the most private manner, on your account; and it is but two days since his majesty came to a full resolution.
“You are very sensible that Skyresh Bolgolam” (Galbet, or high-admiral) “has been your mortal enemy, almost ever since your arrival.
His original reasons I know not; but his hatred is increased since your great success against Blefuscu, by which his glory as admiral is much obscured.
This lord, in conjunction with Flimnap the high-treasurer, whose enmity against you is notorious on account of his lady, Limtoc the general, Lalcon the chamberlain, and Balmuff the grand justiciary, have prepared articles of impeachment against you, for treason and other capital crimes.”
This preface made me so impatient, being conscious of my own merits and innocence, that I was going to interrupt him; when he entreated me to be silent, and thus proceeded: –
“Out of gratitude for the favours you have done me, I procured information of the whole proceedings, and a copy of the articles; wherein I venture my head for your service.
“‘Articles of Impeachment against Quinbus Flestrin, (the Man-Mountain.)
ARTICLE I.
“‘Whereas, by a statute made in the reign of his imperial majesty Calin Deffar Plune, it is enacted, that, whoever shall make water within the precincts of the royal palace, shall be liable to the pains and penalties of hightreason; notwithstanding, the said Quinbus Flestrin, in open breach of the said law, under colour of extinguishing the fire kindled in the apartment of his majesty’s most dear imperial consort, did maliciously, traitorously, and devilishly, by discharge of his urine, put out the said fire kindled in the said apartment, lying and being within the precincts of the said royal palace, against the statute in that case provided, etc. against the duty, etc.
ARTICLE II. “‘That the said Quinbus Flestrin, having brought the imperial fleet of Blefuscu into the royal port, and being afterwards commanded by his imperial majesty to seize all the other ships of the said empire of Blefuscu, and reduce that empire to a province, to be governed by a viceroy from hence, and to destroy and put to death, not only all the Big-endian exiles, but likewise all the people of that empire who would not immediately forsake the Big-endian heresy, he, the said Flestrin, like a false traitor against his most auspicious, serene, imperial majesty, did petition to be excused from the said service, upon pretence of unwillingness to force the consciences, or destroy the liberties and lives of an innocent people.
ARTICLE III. “‘That, whereas certain ambassadors arrived from the Court of Blefuscu, to sue for peace in his majesty’s court, he, the said Flestrin, did, like a false traitor, aid, abet, comfort, and divert, the said ambassadors, although he knew them to be servants to a prince who was lately an open enemy to his imperial majesty, and in an open war against his said majesty.
ARTICLE IV. “‘That the said Quinbus Flestrin, contrary to the duty of a faithful subject, is now preparing to make a voyage to the court and empire of Blefuscu, for which he has received only verbal license from his imperial majesty; and, under colour of the said license, does falsely and traitorously intend to take the said voyage, and thereby to aid, comfort, and abet the emperor of Blefuscu, so lately an enemy, and in open war with his imperial majesty aforesaid.’
“There are some other articles; but these are the most important, of which I have read you an abstract.
“In the several debates upon this impeachment, it must be confessed that his majesty gave many marks of his great lenity; often urging the services you had done him, and endeavouring to extenuate your crimes.
The treasurer and admiral insisted that you should be put to the most painful and ignominious death, by setting fire to your house at night, and the general was to attend with twenty thousand men, armed with poisoned arrows, to shoot you on the face and hands.
Some of your servants were to have private orders to strew a poisonous juice on your shirts and sheets, which would soon make you tear your own flesh, and die in the utmost torture.
The general came into the same opinion; so that for a long time there was a majority against you; but his majesty resolving, if possible, to spare your life, at last brought off the chamberlain.
“Upon this incident, Reldresal, principal secretary for private affairs, who always approved himself your true friend, was commanded by the emperor to deliver his opinion, which he accordingly did; and therein justified the good thoughts you have of him.
He allowed your crimes to be great, but that still there was room for mercy, the most commendable virtue in a prince, and for which his majesty was so justly celebrated.
He said, the friendship between you and him was so well known to the world, that perhaps the most honourable board might think him partial; however, in obedience to the command he had received, he would freely offer his sentiments. That if his majesty, in consideration of your services, and pursuant to his own merciful disposition, would please to spare your life, and only give orders to put out both your eyes, he humbly conceived, that by this expedient justice might in some measure be satisfied, and all the world would applaud the lenity of the emperor, as well as the fair and generous proceedings of those who have the honour to be his counsellors. That the loss of your eyes would be no impediment to your bodily strength, by which you might still be useful to his majesty; that blindness is an addition to courage, by concealing dangers from us; that the fear you had for your eyes, was the greatest difficulty in bringing over the enemy’s fleet, and it would be sufficient for you to see by the eyes of the ministers, since the greatest princes do no more.
“This proposal was received with the utmost disapprobation by the whole board.
Bolgolam, the admiral, could not preserve his temper, but, rising up in fury, said, he wondered how the secretary durst presume to give his opinion for preserving the life of a traitor; that the services you had performed were, by all true reasons of state, the great aggravation of your crimes; that you, who were able to extinguish the fire by discharge of urine in her majesty’s apartment (which he mentioned with horror), might, at another time, raise an inundation by the same means, to drown the whole palace; and the same strength which enabled you to bring over the enemy’s fleet, might serve, upon the first discontent, to carry it back; that he had good reasons to think you were a Big-endian in your heart; and, as treason begins in the heart, before it appears in overt-acts, so he accused you as a traitor on that account, and therefore insisted you should be put to death.
“The treasurer was of the same opinion: he showed to what straits his majesty’s revenue was reduced, by the charge of maintaining you, which would soon grow insupportable; that the secretary’s expedient of putting out your eyes, was so far from being a remedy against this evil, that it would probably increase it, as is manifest from the common practice of blinding some kind of fowls, after which they fed the faster, and grew sooner fat; that his sacred majesty and the council, who are your judges, were, in their own consciences, fully convinced of your guilt, which was a sufficient argument to condemn you to death, without the formal proofs required by the strict letter of the law.
“But his imperial majesty, fully determined against capital punishment, was graciously pleased to say, that since the council thought the loss of your eyes too easy a censure, some other way may be inflicted hereafter.
And your friend the secretary, humbly desiring to be heard again, in answer to what the treasurer had objected, concerning the great charge his majesty was at in maintaining you, said, that his excellency, who had the sole disposal of the emperor’s revenue, might easily provide against that evil, by gradually lessening your establishment; by which, for want of sufficient for you would grow weak and faint, and lose your appetite, and consequently, decay, and consume in a few months; neither would the stench of your carcass be then so dangerous, when it should become more than half diminished; and immediately upon your death five or six thousand of his majesty’s subjects might, in two or three days, cut your flesh from your bones, take it away by cart-loads, and bury it in distant parts, to prevent infection, leaving the skeleton as a monument of admiration to posterity.Once when I was six years old I saw a magnificent picture in a book, called True Stories from Nature, about the primeval forest.
It was a picture of a boa constrictor in the act of swallowing an animal.
Here is a copy of the drawing.
In the book it said: "Boa constrictors swallow their prey whole, without chewing it.
After that they are not able to move, and they sleep through the six months that they need for digestion."
I pondered deeply, then, over the adventures of the jungle.
And after some work with a coloured pencil I succeeded in making my first drawing.
My Drawing Number One.
It looked something like this:
I showed my masterpiece to the grown-ups, and asked them whether the drawing frightened them.
But they answered: "Frighten? Why should any one be frightened by a hat?"
My drawing was not a picture of a hat.
It was a picture of a boa constrictor digesting an elephant.
But since the grown-ups were not able to understand it, I made another drawing: I drew the inside of a boa constrictor, so that the grown-ups could see it clearly.
They always need to have things explained.
My Drawing Number Two looked like this:
The grown-ups' response, this time, was to advise me to lay aside my drawings of boa constrictors, whether from the inside or the outside, and devote myself instead to geography, history, arithmetic, and grammar.
That is why, at the age of six, I gave up what might have been a magnificent career as a painter.
I had been disheartened by the failure of my Drawing Number One and my Drawing Number Two.
Grown-ups never understand anything by themselves, and it is tiresome for children to be always and forever explaining things to them.
So then I chose another profession, and learned to pilot airplanes.
I have flown a little over all parts of the world;
and it is true that geography has been very useful to me.
At a glance I can distinguish China from Arizona.
If one gets lost in the night, such knowledge is valuable.
In the course of this life I have had a great many encounters with a great many people who have been concerned with matters of consequence.
I have lived a great deal among grown-ups.
I have seen them intimately, close at hand.
And that hasn't much improved my opinion of them.
Whenever I met one of them who seemed to me at all clear-sighted, I tried the experiment of showing him my Drawing Number One, which I have always kept.
I would try to find out, so, if this was a person of true understanding.
But, whoever it was, he, or she, would always say:
"That is a hat."
Then I would never talk to that person about boa constrictors, or primeval forests, or stars.
I would bring myself down to his level.
I would talk to him about bridge, and golf, and politics, and neckties.
And the grown-up would be greatly pleased to have met such a sensible man.
So I lived my life alone, without anyone that I could really talk to, until I had an accident with my plane in the Desert of Sahara, six years ago.
Something was broken in my engine.
And as I had with me neither a mechanic nor any passengers, I set myself to attempt the difficult repairs all alone.
It was a question of life or death for me: I had scarcely enough drinking water to last a week.
The first night, then, I went to sleep on the sand, a thousand miles from any human habitation.
I was more isolated than a shipwrecked sailor on a raft in the middle of the ocean.
Thus you can imagine my amazement, at sunrise, when I was awakened by an odd little voice.
It said:
"If you please—draw me a sheep!"
"What!"
"Draw me a sheep!"
I jumped to my feet, completely thunderstruck.
I blinked my eyes hard.
I looked carefully all around me.
And I saw a most extraordinary small person, who stood there examining me with great seriousness.
Here you may see the best portrait that, later, I was able to make of him.
But my drawing is certainly very much less charming than its model.
That, however, is not my fault.
The grown-ups discouraged me in my painter's career when I was six years old, and I never learned to draw anything, except boas from the outside and boas from the inside.
Now I stared at this sudden apparition with my eyes fairly starting out of my head in astonishment.
Remember, I had crashed in the desert a thousand miles from any inhabited region.
And yet my little man seemed neither to be straying uncertainly among the sands, nor to be fainting from fatigue or hunger or thirst or fear.
Nothing about him gave any suggestion of a child lost in the middle of the desert, a thousand miles from any human habitation.
When at last I was able to speak, I said to him:
"But—what are you doing here?"
And in answer he repeated, very slowly, as if he were speaking of a matter of great consequence:
"If you please—draw me a sheep..."
When a mystery is too overpowering, one dare not disobey.
Absurd as it might seem to me, a thousand miles from any human habitation and in danger of death, I took out of my pocket a sheet of paper and my fountain-pen.
But then I remembered how my studies had been concentrated on geography, history, arithmetic and grammar, and I told the little chap (a little crossly, too) that I did not know how to draw.
He answered me:
"That doesn't matter. Draw me a sheep..."
But I had never drawn a sheep, so I drew for him one of the two pictures I had drawn so often.
It was that of the boa constrictor from the outside.
And I was astounded to hear the little fellow greet it with,
"No, no, no! I do not want an elephant inside a boa constrictor.
A boa constrictor is a very dangerous creature, and an elephant is very cumbersome.
Where I live, everything is very small.
What I need is a sheep.
Draw me a sheep."
So then I made a drawing.
He looked at it carefully, then he said:
"No. This sheep is already very sickly.
So I made another drawing.
My friend smiled gently and indulgently.
"You see yourself," he said, "that this is not a sheep.
This is a ram.
It has horns."
So then I did my drawing over once more.
But it was rejected too, just like the others.
"This one is too old.
I want a sheep that will live a long time."
By this time my patience was exhausted, because I was in a hurry to start taking my engine apart, so I tossed off this drawing.
"This is only his box.
The sheep you asked for is inside."
I was very surprised to see a light break over the face of my young judge:
"That is exactly the way I wanted it!
Do you think that this sheep will have to have a great deal of grass?"
"Why?"
"Because where I live everything is very small..."
"There will surely be enough grass for him," I said.
"It is a very small sheep that I have given you."
He bent his head over the drawing.
"Not so small that
—Look!
He has gone to sleep..."
And that is how I made the acquaintance of the little prince.Be healthy!
The next day Dauren came to the playground without his little brother.
Sauran is ill, - explained the boy.
Yesterday he ate too much ice-cream.
He should drink hot tea raspberries, - Vitalik’s advice.
And Sauran will recover fast.
Raspberries in our garden haven’t ripened  yet,-Dauren sighed sadly.
Our raspberries are mellow already! – exclaimed Lilian.
It is wonderful!
Kuzya flew up to Vitalik’s shoulder.
Let’s pick some mellow raspberries in Lilian and Nick’s garden and go to see Sauran.
Hello and good-bye!
Dauren asked the childrWhat do you need to do to make friends with a stranger bird?
Catch it!-said Sauran.
Feed it!-advised Vitalik
No, it is wrong! – objected Dauren.
First, you should say hello to the bird.
Friendship starts with a greeting.
When two birds meet in the sky, they wave to each other,  twitter something cheerful and there will be no quarrel.
When they fly apart, they always say good-bye.
The same is with humans.
Every people has their language, but all peoples in the  world have greeting and farewell words.
Greet according to your clothes
When the children came to their next lesson, Kuzya took them to a small shop.
The shop was selling dresses, sweaters, coats, hats, shoes and carnival costumes.
The saleswoman allowed the kids to try on costumes of fairy tales heroes.
Lilian chose a pretty hat with flowers and turned to a fairy.
Dauren liked knight armors.
Even Sauran didn’t recognize him.
Sauran was unrecognizable too in a costume of an Anglo sax warrior.
Vitalik became a pirate, Nick chose to be a prince.
When the kids played enough, Kuzya said:
We, birds, do not need clothing.
But for people clothes play an important role.
It is about clothing that we will talk about.
Red, orange and blue…, Let’s play the rainbow with you
On the eve of their next lesson Kuzya asked Vitalik to buy a box of watercolours.
Why do you need colours?- Vitalik wondered.
You decided to become a painter?
Why not?!-answered the parrot.
Even dolphins make paintings, a parrots forbidden to do the same?
Vitalik didn’t want to argue and bought watercolours and painting paper.
The next day Kuzya woke up at dawn and made seven painting’s while Vitalik was still asleep.
When the boy saw the paintings, he was very surprised: Kuzya, why did you draw the same toy car at all the paintings but in different colours?
Because today we are going to talk about seven colours of the rainbow.
Then there was a bell ring.
Go to welcome your friends!- the parrot hurried Vitalik up.
As soon as the painting get dry I will start our lesson.
I am this, you are that
Lilian and Nick were late for the lesson.
It was for the first time.
What happened?-the kids asked Lilian
She looked very angry.
Nick has a terrible character,-complained Lilian.
My brother found a carnival costume of a wizard in  our wardrobe.
He put on a wizard hat and went for a walk.
Everybody is laughing at him.
Nick is very stubborn
The friends looked at Nick and started laughing.
The kid looked really funny.
This hat becomes him very much!-said Sauran
With this hat Nick and looks like a real wizard indeed, only like a very little one, -Vitalik tried to support his friend.
It is you who are stubborn,-grumbled Nick from under the hat.
I am not.
I have a good character!
I also have a good character!-got into the conversation Dauren who missed the beginning of the dispute.
I am very cheerful and kind, just like me brother.
This is what we are going to talk about-a person’s character,-Kuzya finally could enter his word in the kids chat, we will talk about what kind of persons we are.
A friend makes a long way shorter
Kuzya, do you have friends?-Lilian asked the parrot.
Sure, I do!-exclaimed Kuzya.
I have many friends:
Sparrow: Chik-chirik, pigeons Fiou and Fiyu, magpie Chichika…
Do you quarrel with each other often?-specified Dauren.
Yes, it happens,-confessed Kuzya. But fortunately not very often and on small matters only.
My friends are the most reliable and faithful birds in the word
They are ready to risk their lives for a friend.
If it were not my friends, we would have to close our school.
The birds made such a noise that the cat got scared and ran away.
Chichika even tore out a flock out of its tail.
I never thought that birds could be so brave!-amazed Sauran
And that birds can be such good friends!-added Vitalik.
I do have wonderful friends, -Kuzya said proudly.
Father, mother, brother and me- we are a happy family
Kuzya suggested having their next lesson at the meadow by a large oak.
The oak has roots, a trunk, branches and leaves.
Tell me if there is anything in common between this tree and your family – said Kuzya
The kids started thinking.
Then Lilian cried out:
I know the answer!
The oak reminds of our family tree.
Our great-grandparents are roots.
Grandparents are a trunk.
Branches are our parents.
Nick and I are leaves on those branches.
Our great-grandmother is 95 years old.
We go to see her very often.
And I have never seen my great-grandfather.
We only have his letters.
He died at war, -complained Vitalik.
People say that everybody must know his predecessors till the seventh generation!-said Sauran
Recently my father and I went to the aoul to see my grandpa.
Grandpa had a birthday.
The whole family gathered for the celebration.
What is your name?
The next day the children met again at the playground.
Vitalik and Kuzya were the first to come
Then Lilian and Nick came.
They greeted the boy and his parrot: Hello!
And Vitalik answered: Zdravstvuite!
Sauran and Dauren were a little late.
The brothers greeted cheerfully their friends: Salem
Kuzya waited till everyone took a seat at the carrousel and began: The topic of our lesson is…
And than a puppy jumped out of bushes.
What a cute puppy!-gasped the children and crowded around the puppy.
What is his name and who is his owner?-asked Sauran
I have never seen this puppy before, - answered Kuzya.
But we will get acquainted right now.
Kuzya nodded to the puppy and asked him something
The puppy ran away but soon came back with a girl.
The girl greeted the kids.
I am Mila
My puppy’s name is Sharik.
He is two months old.
When he grows up, he will be a big dog.
Now, we got acquainted.
Friends from sunny street
A boy named Sauran lives in our town.
He is sex years old.
He likes playing football and drawing.
Sauran has a younger brother Dauren.
Sauran and Dauren live in a green two-storey house in Sunny street.
There is a children playground near by their house.
The brothers have many friends.
These are Gabit, Rita, Ospan and Lisa.
The boys are also friends with Pasha and Petya.
But not a long time ago Sauran and Dauren found new friends who moved in neighbor houses.
A little yellow house with lilac by the window belongs to Grandma Natalia.
She bakes delicious pies and makes jam.
She has a grandson.
His name is Vitalik
He lives in Moscow
He came to spend summer at his Grandma’s place.
Vitalik has a parrot Kuzya that can talk.
Kuzya likes to tumble at his perch and give advice to his friend.
A girl and a boy moved into the pink house with a white porch.
They came from London.
The girl’s name is Lilian.
She can read, count and tailor dresses for her dolls.
Her brother’s name is Nick.
He is four years old.
He is learning to pronounce the letter R
Once all the children met at the playground.
They wanted to play with each other very much but they were not able to, because Sauran and Dauren spoke only Kazakh, Vitaly spoke Russian, Lilian and Nick – only English
And then parrot Kuzya decided to help the children.
He spoke to them in has Parrot language that all the children in the world understand.
If you want to become friends, you must understand and speak three languages: Kazakh, Russian and English.
It was never fitting, brothers, for us to begin the story of Igor’s campaign, Igor Sviatoslavich, Using the ardent words of vexing tales.
This song should begin in accordance with the events of our own time and not as a fantasy of  Boian.
For Boian was a wizard; when he wished to create a song, He would move in all directions through the tree as a squirrel– as a grey wolf along the ground, as a dusky eagle beneath the clouds.
He remembered, he said, the wars of the first times. He would free ten falcons to attack a flock of swans; The first swan seized sang the first song to old Iaroslav, to brave Mstislav who slew Rededia as Cherkess troops looked on, to fair Roman Sviatoslavich.
But Boian’s ten falcons, brothers, attacked no flock of swans. His own magic fingers struck, and strings alive pulsed glory to the princes.
We shall begin then, brothers, this tale from old Vladimir down to the present Igor, Who tensed his mind with battle-strength, quickened his heart
with valor, and, swollen with the spirit of war, Led out his brave troops into the Polovtsian steppe for the land of Rus.
Then Igor looked up at the bright sun and saw all his warriors darkened from it by a shadow.
And Igor said to his retinue:
“Brothers and companions! It is better to be slain than taken captive.
Mount, brothers, your swift horses that we may glimpse the Blue Don.”
In his fervor, the Prince’s foresight ebbed from him, and his zeal to taste the great Don veiled the omen from him.
“I wish,” he said, “to break my lance at the end of the Polovtsian steppe with you, men of Rus; I wish to lay down my head, or drink with my helmet from the Don.”
O Boian! Nightingale of a former time! If you were to chirr the glory of these campaigns, Flitting as a nightingale through the thought-tree, flying in the mind beneath clouds, Weaving glories together at both ends of this time, loping along the path of Troian through the steppes toward the mountains,
You would have sung this song to Igor, the grandson of Oleg:
“No storm has carried the falcons across the wide steppe. Flocks of daws race toward the great Don.”
Or would you sing, wizard Boian, grandson of Veles:
“Horses neigh beyond the Sula; glory rings in Kiev; Trumpets blare in Novgorod; banners stand in Putivl!” Igor awaits his beloved brother,
and Fierce Bull Vsevolod speaks:
“You are my one brother, Igor, my one shining light; we are both sons of Sviatoslav.
Saddle, brother, your swift horses,
for mine are ready, saddled ahead at Kursk.
And these, my men of Kursk, are hardened fighters, swaddled to the blare of trumpets, cradled under war helmets, fed with the tip of the lance.
The paths are known to them, and they know the ravines. Their bows are strung taut; their quivers are opened; their sabres are honed.
They leap like gray wolves in the steppe, seeking honor for themselves and for their prince–glory!”
Then Prince Igor stepped into the golden stirrup, set out through the open steppe.
The sun barred his way with darkness.
Night groaning at him awoke birds with the threat; the howling of beasts rose up.
Div is aroused, he shrieks a command to the unknown land, to the Volga, Pomorie, Posulie, Surozh and Korsun; from the treetops he bids them take heed. “And to you too, O idol of Tmutorokan!”
The Polovtsians, by uncharted routes, raced toward the great Don. Their carts screech at midnight, a sound like startled swans. Igor is leading his warriors to the Don.
In the oak groves birds foretell his misfortunes, and in the ravines wolves stir up a storm; eagles call beasts to the bones; foxes bark at scarlet shields.
O land of Rus! You are already behind the hill!
The night darkens long and is suddenly black;
the morning star has shed its light; mist has covered the steppe;
the nightingale’s trill is stilled; the chatter of daws begins.
The Men of Rus with scarlet shields, have barred the great steppe, seeking honor for themselves and for their prince–glory.
Past dawn on that day they trampled pagan Polovtsian troops. Scattering like arrows over the land, they seized beautiful Polovtsian maidens, And with them gold, brocades, and patterned velvets.
Across the swamps and marshes they began to lay bridges with cloaks, mantles, furs, and all kinds of fine Polovtsian raiments.
The scarlet banner, the white pennon, the scarlet fringe, the silver lance, All to the brave son of Sviatoslav!
Oleg’s bold brood slumbers in the steppe. Far has it flown!
It was not born for the affront of falcon or gerfalcon, or you, black raven, pagan Polovtsian!
Gzak runs as a gray wolf; Konchak shows him the way to the great Don.
Early the second day blood in the sky heralds the light;
black clouds come from the sea with blue lightning flashing within; They will cover the four suns;
there shall be great thunder; there shall he rain with arrows from the great Don;
Here shall the lances be broken; here shall the sabre be dulled on Polovtsian helmets; on the River Kaiala, near the Great Don.
O land of Rus! You are already behind the hill!
These winds, the grandsons of Stribog, blow as arrows, from the sea onto the brave warriors of Igor.
The earth rumbles; rivers flow murkily; dust covers the steppe;
banners speak! Polovtsians come from the Don, from the sea
and from all sides; they have encircled the warriors of Rus.
The devil’s children have barred the steppe with shouting, but the brave Rus have barred their way with scarlet shields.
Fierce Bull Vsevolod! You stand at bay! You dart at the enemy like arrows! You smash helmets with your Frankish sword!
Wherever the Bull leaps, his golden helmet flashing, there lie pagan Polovtsian heads,
their Avar helmets split by tempered sabres, by you, Fierce Bull Vsevolod!
He cursed his wounds, dear brothers, having forgotten honor and life, the city of Chernigov, his father’s golden throne, And the beautiful daughter of Gleb, his beloved’s love and affection.
The times of Troian have passed; the years of Iaroslav are gone; and the campaigns of Oleg, Oleg Sviatoslavich.
With his sword that prince forged discord throughout the land and sowed the earth with arrows.
He steps into the golden stirrup in the city of Tmutorokan!
Distant great Iaroslav had heard that same discord,
but Vsevolod’s son, Vladimir, in Chernigov stopped his ears each morning.
Pride brought Boris Viacheslavich to judgment on the River Kanina. Pride spread a green shroud for the brave and young prince, to the disgrace of Oleg.
From that same Kanina, Sviatopolk cradled his father between Hungarian amblers to Saint Sophia, to Kiev.
Then in the time of Oleg, Son of Woe, the land was sown and it sprouted with discord. The living of Dazhbog’s grandson was ruined; the ages of mankind were cut short by the feuds of the princes;
Throughout the land of Rus the plowman seldom called out, but the ravens often cawed, portioning the corpses among themselves, and grackles called in their tongue, waiting to fly to the feast.
So it was with those wars and those campaigns of the past, but no one has heard such a battle as this. From early morning until evening, from evening until daybreak, tempered arrows fly, sabres crash on helmcts, Frankish lances crack like thunder
in the unknown steppe on the Polovtsian land. Bones were sown and watered with blood in the black earth beneath the hooves; they sprouted up with grief throughout the land of Rus.
What sounds do I hear? What rings to me
just before daybreak? Because he pities his dear brother, Vsevolod, Igor turns back his warriors.
They battled through the day; they fought for another; on the third day at noon, Igor’s banners fell.
There the brothers were parted on the banks of the swift Kaiala.
There the blood-wine ran out;
there the brave sons of Rus completed the feast, gave drink to the matchmakers, they themselves lay down for the land of Rus.
The grass droops with anguish, and the tree with sorrow is bent toward the earth.
For already, brothers, a sorrowful time has begun; emptiness has covered the warriors.
Bitter Obida has come among the forces of Dazhbog’s grandson; she has stepped like a maiden onto the land of Trojan; she has splashed her swan’s wings upon the blue sea; ruffling near the Don, she has awakened baneful times.
Warfare of the princes against the pagans has ceased, for now brother says to brother: “This is mine, and that too!” Princes have begun to say of trifles, “This is a great thing.” One against the other they have begun to forge discord
but the pagans from every land have come for victories.
Too far has the falcon flown, striking birds toward the sea,
and Igor’s brave warriors are not to be resurrected.
Following them, Karna shrieked and Zhelia leapt over the land of Rus,
scattering embers in a flaming horn. The women of Rus lament:
“No longer shall we hold in mind our dear loved ones, or counsel them with our counsel, or see them with our eyes, or touch gold or silver.”
Kiev, brothers, groaned with sorrow, and Chernigov, with constant attacks.
Anguish poured over the land of Rus; thick sadness flowed throughout the Rus land,
but the princes themselves forged discord each against the other.
And the pagans riding victoriously throughout the land of Rus seized from every household a tribute of one squirrel skin.
These two brave sons of Sviatoslav, Igor and Vsevolod, awakened treachery with their strife, Treachery which their father, Sviatoslav, dread great prince of Kiev, had all but stilled–
He who once ruled by threat alone. For he had struck with strong troops and Frankish swords, attacked the Polovtsian land, trampled down the hills and ravines, muddied rivers and lakes, dried up streams and swamps, and like a whirlwind, he snatched up the pagan Kobiak from the curved edge of the sea, from the ironclad Polovtsian troops. And Kobiak came tumbling down in the city of Kiev in the stronghold of Sviatoslav.
Now Germans and Venetians, Greeks and Morava sing glory to Sviatoslav. They reproach Prince Igor who sank his wealth to the bottom of the Kaiala, the Polovtsian river. He filled it with the gold of Rus.
Now Prince Igor dismounted from his saddle of gold into a slave’s saddle.
The ramparts of the cities drooped and joy has ebbed.
On the hills in Kiev, Sviatoslav has seen a murky dream:
“Last night after eventide,” he said, “they were clothing me in a black shroud on a bed of yew.
They laded me blue wine mingled with sorrow,
piled over me empty quivers of the pagan invaders and a great pearl onto my chest;
they comfort me. The beams of my gold-domed palace lack the cross-brace,
and all night from eventide blue ravens caw.
In the thickets at Plesensk there were four brother princes, and they were carrying me toward the dark blue sea.”
The Boyars counseled Sviatoslav:
“O Prince, anguish has seized your mind.
Here are two falcons flown from their father’s golden throne, to seek the city of Tmutorokan, or else to drink with their helmets from the Don. Now the falcons’ wings are clipped by the sabres of the pagans; they are both fettered in iron bands.”
For it was dark on the third day; two suns had darkened; both purple pillars burned out and with them the young moons, Oleg and Sviatoslav. They were veiled in darkness and sank into the sea.
On the River Kaiala they had shown great boldness to the Khin. Darkness has covered the light.
The Polovtsians pour out across the land of Rus like a pride of cheetahs.
Now shame has smothered glory;
force has struck against freedom;
Div has thrown himself to the earth.
Fair Gothic maidens have sung out on the bank of the deep blue sea. Jangling the gold of Rus they sing the time of Booz; they sway with Sharokhan’s vengeance!
And we, O retinue, are thirsty for joy!
Then great Sviatoslav let drop this golden word mingled with tears:
“O, my cousins, Igor and Vsevolod! Too soon you began to harry the Polovtsian land with your swords, Seeking glory for yourselves. Dishonorably you have been vanquished, for you spilt pagan blood dishonorably.
Your brave hearts were forged in hard steel and tempered in boldness.
But why did you do this to my silvery gray head?
I no longer see the power of my strong and wealthy brother, Iaroslav, so mighty in warriors, with his Chernigov nobles, with his knights, his Tatrans, his Shelbirs, his Topchaks, Revugs, and Olbers. For these, without their shields, with only their daggers, routed their foes with a cry, ringing glory to their forefathers.
But you said, “Let us ourselves be valorous. We shall steal the coining glory for ourselves, and for ourselves divide the glory of the past.”
Is it such a wonder, brothers, that an old man springs to life?
If the falcon is fully mature it strikes birds in flight, allows no harm to its nest.
But here is a prince’s woe: I have no aid;
the times have been turned about.
Now in Rimov they call out beneath Polovtsian sabres, and Vladimir cries out beneath his wounds.
Anguish and sorrow to the son of Gleb!
Great Prince Vsevolod! Will you not fly in thought from afar to watch your father’s golden throne?
For you can empty the Volga with oars; You pour out the Don with your helmet
If only you were here, a slave girl would sell for a pittance and a captive for less,
For you can shoot across dry land with your living fire, your brave sons of Gleb.
And you, Wild Riurik, and David! Were you not the ones who swam with golden helmets in blood?
Is it not your brave retinue that roars like wild bulls Wounded by tempered sabres on the unknown steppe?
My lords, step into golden stirrups for the offense of this time, for the land of Rus, for the wounds of Igor, fierce son of Sviatoslav!
O Osmomysl, Iaroslav of Galich! High do you sit on your gold-wrought throne! You have braced the Hunnish mountains with your iron troops. Having barred the king’s path, you have locked the gates of the Danube. Flinging missiles through the clouds, you rule to the Danube;
your threats stream throughout these lands. You open the gates to Kiev, and from your father’s golden throne, you shoot at the Sultan beyond.
My lord, shoot Konchak, the pagan slave, for the land of Rus, for Igor’s wounds, fierce son of Sviatoslav.
And you fierce Roman, and Mstislav! A brave thought carries your mind to the deed.
You glide high in your ferocity, like a falcon soaring on the winds, fiercely seeking to overcome a bird.
For you have iron lads beneath Latin helmets. Because of them the earth trembles and many countries have trembled: Khinova, Lithuania, the Iatviagy, and the Deremela; The Polovtsians as well have thrown down their lances and bowed their heads beneath these Frankish swords.
But already, Prince, the sun’s light has dimmed for Igor, and the tree has shed its leaves in an ill wind.
Along the Ros and the Sula pagans are portioning the cities and Igor’s brave warriors will not be resurrected!
The Don, O Prince, summons you, and calls the princes to victory.
And all the brave sons of Oleg prepare to join the fray.
Ingvar and Vsevolod! And all three sons of Mstislav, six-winged falcons of no mean nest! You have not earned power for yourselves by the right of victories.
Where then are your golden helmets, your Polish lances and shields?
Close the gates to the steppe with your sharp arrows for the land of Rus, for Igor’s wounds, fierce son of Sviatoslav!
Now the silvery current of the Sula no longer flows to the city of Pereiaslavl; The Dvina flows like a swamp for those awesome men of Polotsk.
To the shouts of pagans Iziaslav, Vasilko’s son, Rang out alone with his sharp swords against Lithuanian helmets. He brought down the glory of his grandfather, Vseslav: Iziaslav himself was struck down beneath crimson shields by Lithuanian swords on the bloody turf. And his beloved at the bed
said,
“The wings of birds, O Prince, cast shadows upon your retinue and beasts have been licking their blood.”
His brothers, Briacheslav and Vsevolod, were not there. Alone he dripped out his pearly soul from his brave body through a golden necklace.
Voices have ceased; joy has waned. The trumpets of Gorodets blare,
fiercely praising all the grandsons of Vseslav! Lower your banners; sheathe your dull, damaged swords;
already you have leapt away from your grandfather’s glory!
For with your discords you have begun to welcome the pagans into the land of Rus. What violence from the Polovtsians ever threatened the living of Vseslav?
In the seventh age of Troian,
Vseslav cast lots for a girl, a maiden he desired for himself.
Sustained by cunning, he mounted a horse and galloped to Kiev, touched the shaft of his spear on the gold Kievan throne.
He leapt away from them at Belgorod like a wild beast at midnight wrapped in a blue mist.
Three times he grasped good fortune, opened the gates of Novgorod, smashed the glory of Iaroslav,
and as a wolf leapt to the Nemiga. He blew clean the threshing floor. On the Nemiga sheaves are spread like heads; they thresh them with damask flails. On the threshing floor they lay down life and winnow souls from bodies.
The Nemiga’s bloody banks were sown with evil, sown with the bones of the sons of Rus.
Prince Vseslav judged the people; he ruled the cities for the princes, but at night he roamed as a wolf. From Kiev, before the cock’s crow, he could lope to Tmutorokan; as a wolf he crossed the path of great Horus.
They rang the bells for him at matins, early at St. Sophia, in Polotsk; he heard the sound in Kiev.
And though his wizard’s soul journeyed in another body, still he often suffered misfortune.
Of him the wizard Boian first spoke well-devised words:
“Neither the skillful one nor the craftiest creature, not even the cleverest bird, will escape the Judgment of God.”
O groan, Russian land, recalling the first time and the first princes.
It was not possible to nail that old Vladimir to the hills of Kiev.
Now some of his banners stand with Riurik and others are with David; the pennons wave disparately.
Lances sing
on the Danube! laroslavna’s voice is heard. As a gull the unrecognized one calls out early:
“I shall fly,” she said, “as a gull along the Danube.
I shall rinse my beaver sleeve in the River Kaiala
and wipe away bloody wounds from my Prince’s sturdy body.”
On the ramparts of the city of Putivl, Iaroslavna calls at dawn:
“O wind, Great Wind! Why, my Lord, do you blow so strongly?
Why do you carry arrows of the Khin upon your own light wings against the warriors of my beloved?
Was it too little for you to blow upwards into the clouds, carrying ships on the blue sea?
Why, Lord, have you scattered my joy through the feathergrass?”
At dawn in Putivl, Iaroslavna calls from the ramparts:
“O Dniepr, Son of Fame! You have cut through rocky mountains into the Polovtsian land.
You have cradled upon yourself the boats of Sviatoslav to meet with Kobiak’s host.
My Lord, cradle my loved one to me so that I need not send tears so soon to him upon the sea.
At dawn in Putivl, Iaroslavna calls from the ramparts:
“Bright and thrice-bright Sun! You are warmth and beauty to all!
Why, my Lord, have you spread your hot rays on the warriors of my beloved? There in the waterless steppe they have bent their bows with thirst and closed their quivers in sorrow.”
At midnight the sea began to splash; waterspouts approach like mists. God shows Prince Igor the way from the Polovtsian land onto the land of Rus, to his father’s golden throne.
The lights of evening have gone out; Igor sleeps; Igor wakes; he measures the steppe in his thought from the great Don to the little Donets.
A horse at midnight! Ovlur whistles across the river; he warns the prince that he ought not remain there.
Ovlur shouted; the ground rumbled; the grass rustled. The Polovtsian tents stirred,
but Prince Igor had dashed like an erinine to the weeds, like a white gold-eye to the water.
He leapt onto his swift horse and jumped down from him as a white-footed wolf,
and he sped toward the bend of the Donets and flew as a falcon beneath the mists, slaying geese and swans for all his meals.
If Igor flew as a falcon, then Ovlur sped as a wolf, shaking the cold dew from himself, for they had worn down their swift horses.
The Donets spoke:
“O Prince Igor! there is no little greatness for you, but for Konchak there is anger, and joy for the land of Rus. “
Igor spoke:
“O Donets! there is no little greatness for you, having carried a prince on your waves, spreading green grass for him on your silvery banks, clothing him in warm mists under the shadow of the green tree.
You guarded him with a gold-eye on the water, gulls on your currents, and lapwings on high winds.
Not such was the River Stugna, having a poor current, devouring other brooks and streams, spreading out at its mouth. At its dark banks as the Dnieper it closed over young prince Rostislav.
His mother weeps for the young prince.”
The flowers droop in sorrow, and the tree with sadness is bent toward the earth.
Yet it was not magpies chattering: on Igor’s trail rides Gzak with Konchak.
Now the ravens do not caw; the grackles are silent; no magpies chatter; they only creep through the willows.
The woodpeckers with their hammering show the way to the river; nightingales with their joyful songs announce the coming daybreak.
Gzak says to Konchak:
“If the falcon flies to his nest, we will shoot the falconet with our golden arrows.”
Konchak said to Gzak:
“If the falcon flies to his nest, then we will snare the falconet with a beautiful maiden.”
And Gzak to Konchak:
“If we snare him with a beautiful maiden, we will lose both her and the falconet, and birds will start striking us in the Polovtsian steppe.”
Boian even told campaigns against [the Greeks] from Sviatoslav’s ancient songmaker, who fiercely praised the favorite of Kagan Oleg.
“Woe is the head without the shoulders, the body without a head, the land of Rus without Igor–
the sun shines in the heavens, Prince Igor is in the land of Rus.
Maidens sing on the Danube; their voices are heard across the sea in Kiev.”
Igor rides up the Borichev slope to the Holy Mother of God Pirogoshchaia;
The lands and cities rejoice.
Having already sung a song to the old princes, then one should sing to the young:
Glory to Igor Sviatoslavich, to his brother Vsevolod, and to Vladimir Igorevich!
May the princes and retinue prosper, fighting the pagans for God!
Glory to the princes, and to the retinue, Amen.
