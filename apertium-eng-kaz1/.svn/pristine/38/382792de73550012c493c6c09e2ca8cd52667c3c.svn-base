<seg id="1">Movies can make profits in the hundreds of millions , be they dollars , euro or pounds .</seg>
<seg id="2">In India movies have become an enormous part of the economy .</seg>
<seg id="3">The industry has always been dominated by quite a small number of major studios , like MGM , Warner , Columbia or Paramount .</seg>
<seg id="4">There are many large companies that provide all of the services needed to make movies , such as special effects , lighting , set building .</seg>
<seg id="5">Many of these employees belong to unions who say how much their members must be paid .</seg>
<seg id="6">A huge number of smaller companies also offer services , such as music studios ( which record the music for original movie soundtracks ) and CGI ( computer generated imagery ) .</seg>
<seg id="7">Finally there are movie distribution companies ( which send movies around the world or around a country ) , and advertising companies who let people know about the movie and promote it ( try to make people want to see the movie ) .</seg>
<seg id="8">Movies with famous stars and large budgets ( lots of money ) , are designed to have a wide appeal , so that hopefully millions of people will pay to see them .</seg>
<seg id="9">Movies like this , which always cost the most to make , are called blockbusters .</seg>
<seg id="10">Special effects can add a huge amount to the cost of a movie , especially the newest CGI effects , but people have come to expect them and every blockbuster movie tries to out-do the last .</seg>
<seg id="11">Today in 2008 , some movies can cost up to $ 200 million to make .</seg>
<seg id="12">But when you stop to think that very successful movies can make many times that amount in profit , it is easy to see why the studios keep producing them .</seg>
<seg id="13">This kind of movie will have a lot of promotion through television advertising , billboards and internet sites .</seg>
<seg id="14">In blockbuster movies , there is usually a happy ending , in which all of the problems in the plot ( story ) are figured out or fixed and almost everyone ( except the baddie ) live happily ever after .</seg>
<seg id="15">Some movies have been so successful that the studios keep releasing more and more movies with the same characters and basic plots .</seg>
<seg id="16">At the opposite end of the scale to the blockbuster , there is the independent , art , or Indie movie .</seg>
<seg id="17">These are usually made by small movie companies , or even just a small group of people that do not have much money .</seg>
<seg id="18">Movies like this are very unusual and usually become popular 'underground' ( people tell each other about it ) , so that they become cult , or popular but not mainstream .</seg>
<seg id="19">Independent movies often tell more creative or unusual ( strange ) stories , or may have sad endings that do not appeal to the big studios , because they can not be sure how the public will react to them .</seg>
<seg id="20">They rarely make a lot of money , but if they are successful , the big studios will quickly try to get the people involved to sign a contract with them , by offering them a lot of money to make another movie .</seg>
<seg id="21">It is often the case that the new movie , with its big budget and its stars will be less successful than the first .</seg>
<seg id="22">Movies , also known as films , are a type of visual communication which use moving pictures and sound to tell stories or inform ( help people to learn ) .</seg>
<seg id="23">People in every part of the world watch movies as a type of entertainment , a way to have fun .</seg>
<seg id="24">Fun for some people can mean laughing , while for others it can mean crying , or feeling afraid .</seg>
<seg id="25">Most movies are made so that they can be shown on big screens at cinemas or movie theatres .</seg>
<seg id="26">After movies are shown on movie screens for a period of time ( ranging from a few weeks to several months ) , movies are shown on pay television or cable television , and sold or rented on DVD disks or videocassette tapes , so that people can watch the movies at home .</seg>
<seg id="27">You can also download or stream movies .</seg>
<seg id="28">Later movies are shown on television stations .</seg>
<seg id="29">A movie camera or video camera takes pictures very quickly , usually at 25 pictures ( frames ) every second .</seg>
<seg id="30">When a movie projector , a computer , or a television shows the pictures at that rate , it looks like the things shown in the set of pictures are really moving .</seg>
<seg id="31">Sound is either recorded at the same time , or added later .</seg>
<seg id="32">The sounds in a movie usually include the sounds of people talking ( which is called dialogue ) , music ( which is called the " soundtrack " ) , and sound effects , the sounds of activities that are happening in the movie ( such as doors opening or guns being fired ) .</seg>
<seg id="33">A screenwriter writes a script , which is the story of the movie with words that the actors will say .</seg>
<seg id="34">Then a producer hires people to work on the movie and gets all of the money that will be needed to pay for the actors and the equipment .</seg>
<seg id="35">Producers usually get the money by borrowing it from a bank or by getting investors to lend money to the movie production .</seg>
<seg id="36">Some producers work for a movie studio ; other producers are independent ( they do not work for a movie studio ) .</seg>
<seg id="37">Actors and directors read scripts to find out what to say and what to do .</seg>
<seg id="38">The actors memorize the words from the script that they will say in the movie , and learn the actions that the script tells them to do .</seg>
<seg id="39">Then the director tells the actors what to do and a cameraman takes motion pictures of them with a motion picture camera .</seg>
<seg id="40">When filming has finished , an editor puts the moving pictures together in a way that tells the whole story within a set amount of time .</seg>
<seg id="41">Audio engineers and sound engineers record music and singing and join it with the moving pictures .</seg>
<seg id="42">When the movie is done , many copies of the movie are made by movie labs and put onto movie reels .</seg>
<seg id="43">Then the movie reels are sent to cinemas .</seg>
<seg id="44">An electric machine called a projector shines a very bright light through the movie , and people sitting in a dark room see it on a big screen .</seg>
<seg id="45">A genre is a word for a type of movie or a style of movie .</seg>
<seg id="46">WHERE IS JAMES ?</seg>
<seg id="47">James and Mary are in the garden .</seg>
<seg id="48">The weather is nice today , it is very warm .</seg>
<seg id="49">But yesterday it was very cold ! They could not play outside then .</seg>
<seg id="50">James and Mary love to play , they always play together in the garden in front of the big house .</seg>
<seg id="51">James is a little boy and he is six years old .</seg>
<seg id="52">The little girl is his sister , she is five years old .</seg>
<seg id="53">James has a small dog , the dog is also in the garden now .</seg>
<seg id="54">The dog likes to play with the two children .</seg>
<seg id="55">The dog is very happy now .</seg>
<seg id="56">Does Mary also have a dog ? </seg>
<seg id="57">No , Mary does not have a dog , she has a cat .</seg>
<seg id="58">But the cat is in the house , the cat is sleeping .</seg>
<seg id="59">Their mother is inside the house with the cat , she looks through the window and sees James and Mary playing .</seg>
<seg id="60">James quickly runs to a big old tree , he is hiding from Mary .</seg>
<seg id="61">Do you know why ? Mary is sitting and has her hands in front of her eyes .</seg>
<seg id="62">She can't see anything and she is counting .</seg>
<seg id="63">Why does she do that ? And what is James doing near the tree ?</seg>
<seg id="64">It is a game .</seg>
<seg id="65">When Mary has finished counting she looks around .</seg>
<seg id="66">She is searching for James : where did he go ? Did you see him ?</seg>
<seg id="67">Mary does not know where James is .</seg>
<seg id="68">She asks the dog : " Did you see James ? " .</seg>
<seg id="69">But the dog can not speak of course ! </seg>
<seg id="70">So Mary gets no answer to her question .</seg>
<seg id="71">People never get an answer when they speak to dogs !</seg>
<seg id="72">Mary looks at her mother behind the window , her mother is laughing .</seg>
<seg id="73">Mary thinks that she has seen where James went : </seg>
<seg id="74">" Tell me where he is ! " , she says to her mother .</seg>
<seg id="75">" No Mary , I can't tell you ! " , she replies .</seg>
<seg id="76">Although she probably knows where he is , she does not want to tell .</seg>
<seg id="77">Mary slowly walks through the garden .</seg>
<seg id="78">She is still trying to find James .</seg>
<seg id="79">She looks under the table and under the chairs , but James is not there .</seg>
<seg id="80">She looks everywhere but she can not find James .</seg>
<seg id="81">Then she hears a sound , it is coming from behind the big old tree .</seg>
<seg id="82">Could that be James ? There is the sound again ! She listens carefully .</seg>
<seg id="83">It is not a bird or another animal .</seg>
<seg id="84">She can hear it well now .</seg>
<seg id="85">It must be James !</seg>
<seg id="86">Then she also sees a little hand and when she walks closer she also sees his head ! </seg>
<seg id="87">She laughs and says : " I found you ! " .</seg>
<seg id="88">They are both happy and go to the house , it is time to eat something and drink some water !</seg>
<seg id="89">The Kyrgyz Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic was set up in 1920 and was renamed the Kazakh Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic in 1925 when the Kazakhs were differentiated officially from the Kyrgyz .</seg>
<seg id="90">The Russian Empire recognised the ethnic difference between the two groups ; it called them both Kyrgyz to avoid confusion between the terms Kazakh and Cossack ( both names originating from Turkic " free man " ) .</seg>
<seg id="91">In keeping with practices in other republics at that time , the parliament had named Nazarbayev its chairman , and then , soon afterward , it had converted the chairmanship to the presidency of the republic .</seg>
<seg id="92">In contrast to the presidents of the other republics , especially those in the independence-minded Baltic states , Nazarbayev remained strongly committed to the perpetuation of the Soviet Union throughout the spring and summer of 1991 .</seg>
<seg id="93">He took this position largely because he considered the republics too interdependent economically to survive separation .</seg>
<seg id="94">At the same time , however , Nazarbayev fought hard to secure republic control of Kazakhstan's enormous mineral wealth and industrial potential .</seg>
<seg id="95">This objective became particularly important after 1990 , when it was learned that Gorbachev had negotiated an agreement with Chevron , an American oil company , to develop Kazakhstan's Tengiz oil fields .</seg>
<seg id="96">Gorbachev did not consult Nazarbayev until talks were nearly complete .</seg>
<seg id="97">At Nazarbayev's insistence , Moscow surrendered control of the republic's mineral resources in June 1991 .</seg>
<seg id="98">Gorbachev's authority crumbled rapidly throughout 1991 .</seg>
<seg id="99">Nazarbayev , however , continued to support him , persistently urging other republic leaders to sign the revised Union Treaty , which Gorbachev had put forward in a last attempt to hold the Soviet Union together .</seg>
<seg id="100">Kazakhstan has followed the same general political pattern as the other four Central Asian states .</seg>
<seg id="101">After declaring independence from the Soviet political structure completely dominated by Moscow and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union ( CPSU ) until 1991 , Kazakhstan retained the basic governmental structure and , in fact , most of the same leadership that had occupied the top levels of power in 1990 .</seg>
<seg id="102">Nursultan Nazarbayev , first secretary of the Communist Party of Kazakhstan ( CPK ) beginning in 1989 , was elected president of the republic in 1991 and remained in undisputed power five years later .</seg>
<seg id="103">Nazarbayev took several effective steps to ensure his position .</seg>
<seg id="104">The constitution of 1993 made the prime minister and the Council of Ministers responsible solely to the president , and in 1995 a new constitution reinforced that relationship .</seg>
<seg id="105">Furthermore , opposition parties were severely limited by legal restrictions on their activities .</seg>
<seg id="106">Within that rigid framework , Nazarbayev gained substantial popularity by limiting the economic shock of separation from the security of the Soviet Union and by maintaining ethnic harmony in the highly diverse country with more than 100 different nationalities .</seg>
<seg id="107">With the words " Elementary , my dear Watson .</seg>
<seg id="108">" , the most famous detective of all time , Sherlock Holmes , starts to explain a crime to his friend , Dr.Watson .</seg>
<seg id="109">That phrase has now entered the English language .</seg>
<seg id="110">Sherlock Holmes first appeared in a book called 'Study in Scarlet' .</seg>
<seg id="111">He became famous in 'The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes' , first published in the 'Strand Magazine' .</seg>
<seg id="112">After that came a whole series of books about him : 'The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes , 'The Return of Sherlock Holmes' , 'The Hound of the Baskervilles' , and many others .</seg>
<seg id="113">Many thousands of the Sherlock Holmes books are still sold every year .</seg>
<seg id="114">Who invented Sherlock Holmes ? Arthur Conan Doyle was his inventor .</seg>
<seg id="115">Arthur Conan Doyle was born in Scotland , of Irish parents .</seg>
<seg id="116">He was a doctor .</seg>
<seg id="117">In 1882 he moved from Scotland to England , to Southsea near Portsmouth , to set up a practice .</seg>
<seg id="118">One of the doctors he worked for , Dr. Joseph Bell , was the model for Sherlock Holmes's friend , Dr. Watson .</seg>
<seg id="119">Conan Doyle's medical knowledge was a great help to him in his detective stories .</seg>
<seg id="120">Conan Doyle started the fashion of the detective story .</seg>
<seg id="121">Today the fashion goes on — with Simenon's Inspector Maigret stories and the stories of other writers .</seg>
<seg id="122">And what sort of man is Sherlock Holmes ? We learn a lot about him from the stories in which he appears .</seg>
<seg id="123">He has a thin face and intelligent eyes .</seg>
<seg id="124">He speaks when he has something to say .</seg>
<seg id="125">He smokes a pipe ( he has a collection of them ) .</seg>
<seg id="126">He plays the violin .</seg>
<seg id="127">He lives at 221 'B' Baker Street in London .</seg>
<seg id="128">If you go to London , you will not be able to find 221 'B' Baker Street .</seg>
<seg id="129">But instead , you can go to a pub called " The Sherlock Holmes " in Northumberland Street ( near Trafalgar Square ) .</seg>
<seg id="130">In that pub there is a room like Sherlock Holmes's room at 221 'B' Baker Street , as described in Conan Doyle's stories .</seg>
<seg id="131">Sherlock Holmes after more than eighty years is still the most famous detective in the world .</seg>
<seg id="132">Sir Arthur Conan Doyle , the novelist , first created his famous character , Sherlock Holmes , in 1885 .</seg>
<seg id="133">Six years later , when he wrote another group of stories about the detective , Sherlock Holmes was a name that everybody knew .</seg>
<seg id="134">When Conan Doyle began to get tired of writing detective stories , he decided to 'kill' Holmes .</seg>
<seg id="135">He wrote a story in which Holmes meets his great enemy , Professor Moriarty , in Switzerland .</seg>
<seg id="136">Holmes and Moriarty fight , and fall over a cliff and are both killed .</seg>
<seg id="137">The public didn't like it .</seg>
<seg id="138">Conan Doyle had to write another story in which Holmes comes back .</seg>
<seg id="139">Conan Doyle was a famous writer .</seg>
<seg id="140">He became popular because of his love for people .</seg>
